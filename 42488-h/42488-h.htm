<p>Protracted suffering, recognised as chastisement
for sin, had wasted the psalmist's strength.
It had been borne for a while in silence, but the rush
of emotion had burst the floodgates. The psalm does
not repeat the words which forced themselves from the
hot heart, but preserves for us the calmer flow which
followed. It falls into four parts, the first three of
which contain three verses each, and the fourth is
expanded into four, divided into two couples.</p>

<p>In the first part (vv. 1-3) the frustrated resolve
of silence is recorded. Its motive was fear of sinning
in speech "while the wicked is before me." That
phrase is often explained as meaning that the sight of
the prosperity of the godless in contrast with his own
sorrows tempted the singer to break out into arraigning
God's providence, and that he schooled himself to look
at their insolent ease unmurmuringly. But the psalm
has no other references to other men's flourishing
condition; and it is more in accordance with its tone
to suppose that his own pains, and not their pleasures,
prompted to the withheld words. The presence of
"the wicked" imposed on his devout heart silence as
a duty. We do not complain of a friend's conduct in
the hearing of his enemies. God's servants have to
watch their speech about Him when godless ears are
listening, lest hasty words should give occasion for
malicious glee or blasphemy. So, for God's honour,
the psalmist put restraint on himself. The word
rendered "bridle" in ver. 2 by the A.V. and R.V. is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
better taken as muzzle, for a muzzle closes the lips, and
a bridle does not. The resolution thus energetically
expressed was vigorously carried out: "I made myself
dumb in still submission; I kept silence." And what
came of it? "My sorrow was stirred." Grief suppressed
is increased, as all the world knows. The
closing words of ver. 2 <i>b</i> (lit. <i>apart from good</i>) are
obscure, and very variously understood, some regarding
them as an elliptical form of "from good and bad," and
expressing completeness of silence; others taking "the
good" to mean "the law, or the praise of God, or
good-fortune, or such words as would serve to protect
the singer from slanders." "But the preposition here
employed, when it follows a verb meaning silence,
does not introduce that concerning which silence is
kept, but a negative result of silence" (Hupfeld). The
meaning, then, is best given by some such paraphrase
as "joylessly" or "and I had no comfort" (R.V.).
The hidden sorrow gnawed beneath the cloak like a
fire in a hollow tree; it burned fiercely unseen, and
ate its way at last into sight. Locked lips make hearts
hotter. Repression of utterance only feeds the fire, and
sooner or later the "muzzle" is torn off, and pent-up
feeling breaks into speech, often the wilder for the
violence done to nature by the attempt to deny it its
way. The psalmist's motive was right, and in a
measure his silence was so; but his resolve did not
at first go deep enough. It is the heart, not the mouth,
that has to be silenced. To build a dam across a
torrent without diminishing the sources that supply
its waters only increases weight and pressure, and
ensures a muddy flood when it bursts.</p>

<p>Does the psalm proceed to recount what its author
said when he broke silence? It may appear so at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
first sight. On the other hand, the calm prayer which
follows, beginning with ver. 4, is not of the character
of the wild and whirling words which were suppressed
for fear of sinning, nor does the fierce fire of which
the psalm has been speaking flame in it. It seems,
therefore, more probable that those first utterances, in
which the overcharged heart relieved itself, and which
were tinged with complaint and impatience, are not
preserved, and did not deserve to be, and that the
pathetic, meditative petitions of the rest of the psalm
succeeded them, as after the first rush of the restrained
torrent comes a stiller flow. Such a prayer might well
have been offered "while the wicked is before me,"
and might have been laid to heart by them. Its
thoughts are as a cool hand laid on the singer's hot
heart. They damp the fire burning in him. There is
no surer remedy for inordinate sensibility to outward
sorrows than fixed convictions of life's brevity and
illusoriness; and these are the two thoughts which the
prayer casts into sweet, sad music.</p>

<p>It deals with commonplaces of thought, which poets
and moralists have been singing and preaching since
the world began, in different tones and with discordant
applications, sometimes with fierce revolt against the
inevitable, sometimes with paralysing consciousness of
it, sometimes using these truths as arguments for base
pleasures and aims, sometimes toying with them as
occasions for cheap sentiment and artificial pathos,
sometimes urging them as motives for strenuous toil.
But of all the voices which have ever sung or prophesied
of life's short span and shadowy activities, none is
nobler, saner, healthier, and calmer than this psalmist's.
The stately words in which he proclaimed the transiency
of all earthly things are not transient. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
"nothing but a breath," but they have outlasted much
that seemed solid, and their music will sound as long
as man is on his march through time. Our "days"
have a "measure"; they are a limited period, and the
Measurer is God. But this fleeting creature man has
an obstinate fancy of his permanence, which is not all
bad indeed&mdash;since without it there would be little
continuity of purpose or concentration of effort&mdash;but
may easily run to extremes and hide the fact that there
is an end. Therefore the prayer for Divine illumination
is needed, that we may not be ignorant of that
which we know well enough, if we would bethink ourselves.
The solemn convictions of ver. 5 are won by
the petitions of ver. 4. He who asks God to make
him know his end has already gone far towards knowing
it. If he seeks to estimate the "measure" of his
days, he will soon come to the clear conviction that it
is only the narrow space that may be covered by one
or two breadths of a hand. So do noisy years shrink
when heaven's chronology is applied to them. A lifetime
looks long, but set against God's eternal years,
it shrivels to an all but imperceptible point, having
position, but not magnitude.</p>

<p>The thought of brevity naturally draws after it that
of illusoriness. Just because life is so frail does it
assume the appearance of being futile. Both ideas
are blended in the metaphors of "a breath" and "a
shadow." There is a solemn earnestness in the threefold
"surely," confirming each clause of the seer's
insight into earth's hollowness. How emphatically he
puts it in the almost pleonastic language, "Surely
nothing but a breath is every man, stand he ever so
firm." The truth proclaimed is undeniably certain.
It covers the whole ground of earthly life, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
includes the most prosperous and firmly established.
"A breath" is the very emblem of transiency and of
unsubstantiality. Every solid body can be melted and
made gaseous vapour, if heat enough is applied.
They who habitually bring human life "before Thee"
dissolve into vapour the solid-seeming illusions which
cheat others, and save their own lives from being but
a breath by clearly recognising that they are.</p>

<p>The Selah at the end of ver. 4 does not here seem to
mark a logical pause in thought nor to coincide with the
strophe division, but emphasises by some long-drawn,
sad notes the teaching of the words. The thought
runs on unbroken, and ver. 6 is closely linked to ver. 5
by the repeated "surely" and "breath" as well as in
subject. The figure changes from breath to "shadow,"
literally "image," meaning not a sculptured likeness,
but an <i>eidolon</i>, or unsubstantial apparition.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The glories of our birth and state<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are shadows, not substantial things";<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and all the movements of men coming and going in
the world are but like a dance of shadows. As they
are a breath, so are their aims. All their hubbub and
activity is but like the bustle of ants on their hill&mdash;immense
energy and toil, and nothing coming of it all.
If any doubt remained as to the correctness of this
judgment of the aimlessness of man's toil, one fact
would confirm the psalmist's sentence, viz., that the
most successful man labours to amass, and has to leave
his piles for another whom he does not know, to gather
into his storehouses and to scatter by his prodigality.
There may be an allusion in the words to harvesting
work. The sheaves are piled up, but in whose barn
are they to be housed? Surely, if the grower and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
reaper is not the ultimate owner, his toil has been for
a breath.</p>

<p>All this is no fantastic pessimism. Still less is it an
account of what life must be. If any man's is nothing
but toiling for a breath, and if he himself is nothing but
a breath, it is his own fault. They who are joined to
God have "in their embers something that doth live";
and if they labour for Him, they do <i>not</i> labour for vanity,
nor do they leave their possessions when they die.
The psalmist has no reference to a future life, but the
immediately following strophe shows that, though he
knew that his days were few, he knew, too, that, if his
hope were set on God he was freed from the curse of
illusoriness and grasped no shadow, but the Living
Substance, who would make his life blessedly real and
pour into it substantial good.</p>

<p>The effect of such convictions of life's brevity and
emptiness should be to throw the heart back on God.
In the third part of the psalm (vv. 7-9) a higher strain
sounds. The singer turns from his dreary thoughts,
which might so easily become bitter ones, to lay hold
on God. What should earth's vanity teach but God's
sufficiency? It does not need the light of a future life
to be flashed upon this mean, swiftly vanishing present
in order to see it "apparelled in celestial light." Without
that transforming conception, it is still possible to
make it great and real by bringing it into conscious
connection with God; and if hope and effort are set on
Him amid all the smallnesses and perishablenesses of
the outer world, hope will not chase a shadow, nor
effort toil for very vanity. The psalmist sought to calm
his hot heart by the contemplation of his end, but that
is a poor remedy for perturbation and grief unless it
leads to actual contact with the one enduring Substance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
It did so with him, and therefore "grief grew calm,"
just because "hope was" not "dead." To preach the
vanity of all earthly things to heavy hearts is but pouring
vinegar on nitre, unless it is accompanied with the
great antidote to all sad and depreciating views of life:
the thought that in it men may reach their hands
beyond the time-film that enmeshes them and grasp the
unchanging God. This psalm has no reference to life
beyond the grave; but it finds in present communion by
waiting and hope, emancipation from the curse of fleeting
triviality which haunts every life separated from
Him, like that which the Christian hope of immortality
gives. God is the significant figure which gives value
to the row of ciphers of which every life is without
Him made up. Blessed are they who are driven by
earth's vanity and drawn by God's fulness of love and
power to fling themselves into His arms and nestle
there! The strong recoil of the devout soul from a
world which it has profoundly felt to be shadowy, and
its great venture of faith, which is not a venture after
all, were never more nobly or simply expressed than in
that quiet "And now"&mdash;things being so&mdash;"what wait
I for? My hope"&mdash;in contrast with the false directions
which other men's takes&mdash;"to Thee it turns."</p>

<p>The burden is still on the psalmist's shoulders. His
sufferings are not ended, though his trust has taken the
poison out of them. Therefore his renewed grasp of God
leads at once to prayer for deliverance from his "transgressions,"
in which cry may be included both sins and
their chastisement. "The fool" is the name of a class,
not of an individual, and, as always in Scripture, denotes
moral and religious obliquity, not intellectual feebleness.
The expression is substantially equivalent to "the
wicked" of ver. 1, and a similar motive to that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
there induced the psalmist to be silent is here urged as
a plea with God for the sufferer's deliverance. Taunts
launched at a good man suffering will glance off him
and appear to reach his God.</p>

<p>Ver. 9 pleads as a reason for God's deliverance the
psalmist's silence under what he recognised as God's
chastisement. The question arises whether this is the
same silence as is referred to in vv. 1, 2, and many
authorities take that view. But that silence was broken
by a rush of words from a hot heart, and, if the account
of the connection in the psalm given above is correct,
by a subsequent more placid meditation and prayer.
It would be irrelevant to recur to it here, especially as
a plea with God. But there are two kinds of silence
under His chastisements: one which may have for its
motive regard to His honour, but is none the less
tinged with rebellious thoughts, and brings no good to
the sufferer, and another which is silence of heart and
will, not of lips only, and soothes sorrow which the
other only aggravated, and puts out the fire which the
other fanned. Submission to God's hand discerned
behind all visible causes is the blessed silence. "To
lie still, let Him strike home, and bless the rod," is
best. And when that is attained, the uses of chastisement
are accomplished; and we may venture to ask
God to burn the rod. The desire to be freed from its
blow is not inconsistent with such submission. This
prayer does not break the silence, though it may seem
to do so, for this is the privilege of hearts that love
God: that they can breathe desires to Him without
His holding them unsubmissive to His supreme will.</p>

<p>The last part (vv. 10-13) is somewhat abnormally
long, and falls into two parts separated by "Selah,"
which musical note does not here coincide with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
greater divisions. The two pairs of verses are both
petitions for removal of sickness, either real or figurative.
Their pleading persistence presents substantially
the same prayer and supports it by the same considerations
of man's transiency. The Pattern of perfect
resignation thrice "prayed, saying the same words";
and His suffering followers may do the same, and yet
neither sin by impatience, nor weary the Judge by
their continual coming. The psalmist sees in his pains
God's "stroke," and pleads the effects already produced
on him as a reason for cessation. He is already
"wasted by the assault of God's hand." One more
buffet, and he feels that he must die. It is bold for a
sufferer to say to God, "Hold! enough!" but all
depends on the tone in which it is said. It may be
presumption, or it may be a child's free speech, not in
the least trenching on a Father's authority. The
sufferer underrates his capacity of endurance, and often
thinks, "I can bear no straw more"; but yet he has to
bear it. Yet the psalmist's cry rests upon a deep
truth: that God cannot mean to crush; therefore he
goes on to a deeper insight into the meaning of that
"stroke." It is not the attack of an enemy, but the
"correction" of a friend.</p>

<p>If men regarded sorrows and sicknesses as rebukes
for iniquity, they would better understand why sinful
life, separated from God, is so fleeting. The characteristic
ground tone of the Old Testament echoes here,
according to which "the wages of sin is death." The
commonplace of man's frailty receives a still more
tragic colouring when thus regarded as a consequence
of his sin. The psalmist has learned it in relation to
his own sufferings, and, because he sees it so clearly,
he pleads that these may cease. He looks on his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
wasted form; and God's hand seems to him to have
taken away all that made it or life desirable and fair, as
a moth would gnaw a garment. What a daring figure
to compare the mightiest with the feeblest, the Eternal
with the very type of evanescence!</p>

<p>The second subdivision of this part (vv. 12, 13)
reiterates the former with some difference of tone.
There is a beautiful climax of earnestness in the
psalmist's appeal to God. His prayer swells into
crying, and that again melts into tears, which go
straight to the great Father's heart. Weeping eyes
are never turned to heaven in vain; the gates of
mercy open wide when the hot drops touch them.
But his fervour of desire is not this suppliant's chief
argument with God. His meditation has won for him
deeper insight into that transiency which at first he
had only laid like ice on his heart, to cool its feverish
heat. He sees now more clearly, by reason of his
effort to turn away his hope from earth and fix it on
God, that his brief life has an aspect in which its brevity
is not only calming, but exalting, and gives him a claim
on God, whose guest he is while here, and with whom
he has guest-rights, whether his stay is longer or
shorter. "The land is mine, for ye are strangers and
sojourners with me" (Lev. xxv. 23). That which was
true in a special way of Israel's tenure of the soil is
true for the individual, and true for ever. All men are
God's guests; and if we betake ourselves behind the
curtains of His tent, we have rights of shelter and
sustenance. All the bitterness of the thought of the
brevity of life is sucked out of it by such a confidence.
If a man dwells with God, his Host will care for the
needs, and not be indifferent to the tears, of His guest.
The long generations which have come and gone like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
shadows are not a melancholy procession out of nothing
through vanity into nothing again, nor "disquieted in
vain," if they are conceived as each in turn lodging for
a little while in that same ancestral home which the
present generation inhabits. It has seen many sons
succeeding their fathers as its tenants, but its stately
strength grows not old, and its gates are open to-day
as they have been in all generations.</p>

<p>The closing prayer in ver. 13 has a strange sound.
"Look away from me" is surely a singular petition,
and the effect of God's averting His face is not less
singular. The psalmist thinks that it will be his
regaining cheerfulness and brightness, for he uses a
word which means to clear up or to brighten, as the
sky becomes blue again after storm. The light of
God's face makes men's faces bright. "They cried
unto God, and were lightened," not because He looked
away from them, but because He regarded them. But
the intended paradox gives the more emphatic expression
to the thought that the psalmist's pains came from God's
angry look, and it is that which he asks may be turned
from him. That mere negative withdrawal, however,
would have no cheering power, and is not conceivable as
unaccompanied by the turning to the suppliant of God's
loving regard. The devout psalmist had no notion of
a neutral God, nor could he ever be contented with
simple cessation of the tokens of Divine displeasure.
The ever-outflowing Divine activity must reach every
man. It may come in one or other of the two forms
of favour or of displeasure, but come it will; and each
man can determine which side of that pillar of fire and
cloud is turned to him. On one side is the red glare of
anger, on the other the white lustre of love. If the
one is turned from, the other is turned to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Not less remarkable is the prospect of going away
into non-being which the last words of the psalm
present as a piteous reason for a little gleam of brightness
being vouchsafed in this span-long life. There
is no vision here of life beyond the grave; but, though
there is not, the singer "throws himself into the arms
of God." He does not seek to solve the problem of
life by bringing the future in to redress the balance
of good and evil. To him the solution lies in present
communion with a present God, in whose house he is
a guest now, and whose face will make his life bright,
however short it may be.</p>

<p>The closing verses of this psalm reappear with
slight changes as an independent whole in
Psalm lxx. The question arises whether that is a
fragment or this a conglomerate. Modern opinion
inclines to the latter alternative, and points in support
to the obvious change of tone in the second part. But
that change does not coincide with the supposed line of
junction, since Psalm lxx. begins with our ver. 13, and
the change begins with ver. 12. Cheyne and others
are therefore obliged to suppose that ver. 12 is the
work of a third poet or compiler, who effected a junction
thereby. The cumbrousness of the hypothesis of fusion
is plain, and its necessity is not apparent, for it is
resorted to in order to explain how a psalm which keeps
so lofty a level of confidence at first should drop to
such keen consciousness of innumerable evils and
such faint-heartedness. But surely such resurrection
of apparently dead fears is not uncommon in devout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
sensitive souls. They live beneath April skies, not
unbroken blue. However many the wonderful works
which God has done and however full of thankfulness
the singer's heart, his deliverance is not complete. The
contrast in the two parts of the psalm is true to facts
and to the varying aspects of feeling and of faith.
Though the latter half gives greater prominence to
encompassing evils, they appear but for a moment; and
the prayer for deliverance which they force from the
psalmist is as triumphant in faith as were the thanksgivings
of the former part. In both the ground tone
is that of victorious grasp of God's help, which in the
one is regarded in its mighty past acts, and in the
other is implored and trusted in for present and future
needs. The change of tone is not such as to demand
the hypothesis of fusion. The unity is further supported
by verbal links between the parts: <i>e.g.</i>, the
innumerable evils of ver. 12 pathetically correspond to
the innumerable mercies of ver. 5, and the same word
for "surpass" occurs in both verses; "be pleased" in
ver. 13 echoes "Thy pleasure" (will, A.V.) in ver. 8;
"cares" or <i>thinks</i> (A.V.) in ver. 17 is the verb from
which the noun rendered <i>purposes</i> (thoughts, A.V.) in
ver. 5 is derived.</p>

<p>The attribution of the psalm to David rests solely on
the superscription. The contents have no discernible
points of connection with known circumstances in his
or any other life. Jeremiah has been thought of as the
author, on the strength of giving a prosaic literal meaning
to the obviously poetical phrase "the pit of destruction"
(ver. 2). If it is to be taken literally, what is to be
made of the "rock" in the next clause? Baethgen
and others see the return from Babylon in the glowing
metaphors of ver. 2, and, in accordance with their conceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of the evolution of spiritual religion, take the
subordination of sacrifice to obedience as a clear token
of late date. We may, however, recall 1 Sam. xv. 22,
and venture to doubt whether the alleged process of
spiritualising has been so clearly established, and its
stages dated, as to afford a criterion of the age of a
psalm.</p>

<p>In the first part, the current of thought starts from
thankfulness for individual deliverances (vv. 1-3);
widens into contemplation of the blessedness of trust and
the riches of Divine mercies (vv. 4, 5); moved by these
and taught what is acceptable to God, it rises to self-consecration
as a living sacrifice (vv. 6-8); and, finally,
pleads for experience of God's grace in all its forms on
the ground of past faithful stewardship in celebrating
these (vv. 9-11). The second part is one long-drawn
cry for help, which admits of no such analysis, though
its notes are various.</p>

<p>The first outpouring of the song is one long sentence,
of which the clauses follow one another like sunlit
ripples, and tell the whole process of the psalmist's
deliverance. It began with patient waiting; it ended
with a new song. The voice first raised in a cry, shrill
and yet submissive enough to be heard above, is at last
tuned into new forms of uttering the old praise. The two
clauses of ver. 1 ("I" and "He") set over against each
other, as separated by the distance between heaven and
earth, the psalmist and his God. He does not begin
with his troubles, but with his faith. "Waiting, he
waited" for Jehovah; and wherever there is that attitude
of tense and continuous but submissive expectance,
God's attitude will be that of bending to meet it. The
meek, upturned eye has power to draw His towards
itself. That is an axiom of the devout life confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
by all experience, even if the tokens of deliverance delay
their coming. Such expectance, however patient, is not
inconsistent with loud crying, but rather finds voice in
it. Silent patience and impatient prayer, in too great a
hurry to let God take His own time, are equally imperfect.
But the cry, "Haste to my help" (ver. 13), and
the final petition, "My God, delay not," are consistent
with true waiting.</p>

<p>The suppliant and God have come closer together
in ver. 2, which should not be regarded as beginning
a new sentence. As in Psalm xviii., prayer brings God
down to help. His hand reaches to the man prisoned
in a pit or struggling in a swamp; he is dragged out, set
on a rock, and feels firm ground beneath his feet. Obviously
the whole representation is purely figurative, and
it is hopelessly flat and prosaic to refer it to Jeremiah's
experience. The "many waters" of Psalm xviii. are
a parallel metaphor. The dangers that threatened
the psalmist are described as "a pit of destruction,"
as if they were a dungeon into which whosoever was
thrown would come out no more, or in which, like
a wild beast, he has been trapped. They are also
likened to a bog or quagmire, in which struggles only
sink a man deeper. But the edge of the bog touches
rock, and there is firm footing and unhindered walking
there, if only some great lifting power can drag the
sinking man out. God's hand can, and does, because
the lips, almost choked with mire, could yet cry. The
psalmist's extremity of danger was probably much
more desperate than is usual in such conditions as
ours, so that his cries seem too piercing for us to
make our own; but the terrors and conflicts of humanity
are nearly constant quantities, though the occasions
calling them forth are widely different. If we look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
deeper into life than its surface, we shall learn that
it is not violent "spiritualising" to make these utterances
the expression of redeeming grace, since in
truth there is but one or other of these two possibilities
open for us. Either we flounder in a bottomless bog,
or we have our feet on the Rock.</p>

<p>God's deliverance gives occasion for fresh praise.
The psalmist has to add his voice to the great chorus,
and this sense of being but one of a multitude, who
have been blessed alike and therefore should bless
alike, occasions the significant interchange in ver. 3
of "my" and "our," which needs no theory of the
speaker being the nation to explain it. It is ever a
joy to the heart swelling with the sense of God's
mercies to be aware of the many who share the
mercies and gratitude. The cry for deliverance is
a solo; the song of praise is choral. The psalmist did
not need to be bidden to praise; a new song welled
from his lips as by inspiration. Silence was more
impossible to his glad heart than even to his sorrow.
To shriek for help from the bottom of the pit and to
be dumb when lifted to the surface is a churl's part.</p>

<p>Though the song was new in this singer's mouth,
as befitted a recipient of deliverances fresh from heaven,
the theme was old; but each new voice individualises
the commonplaces of religious experience, and repeats
them as fresh. And the result of one man's convinced
and jubilant voice, giving novelty to old truths because
he has verified them in new experiences, will be that
"many shall see," as though they behold the deliverance
of which they hear, "and shall fear" Jehovah
and trust themselves to Him. It was not the psalmist's
deliverance, but his song, that was to be the agent in
this extension of the fear of Jehovah. All great poets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
have felt that their words would win audience and live.
Thus, even apart from consciousness of inspiration,
this lofty anticipation of the effect of his words is
intelligible, without supposing that their meaning is
that the signal deliverance of the nation from captivity
would spread among heathens and draw them to
Israel's faith.</p>

<p>The transition from purely personal experience to
more general thoughts is completed in vv. 4, 5. Just
as the psalmist began with telling of his own patient
expectance and thence passed on to speak of God's
help, so in these two verses he sets forth the same
sequence in terms studiously cast into the most comprehensive
form. Happy indeed are they who can
translate their own experience into these two truths
for all men: that trust is blessedness and that God's
mercies are one long sequence, made up of numberless
constituent parts. To have these for one's inmost convictions
and to ring them out so clearly and melodiously
that many shall be drawn to listen, and then to verify
them by their own "seeing," is one reward of patient
waiting for Jehovah. That trust must be maintained
by resolute resistance to temptations to its opposite.
Hence the negative aspect of trust is made prominent
in ver. 4 <i>b</i>, in which the verb should be rendered
"turns not" instead of "respecteth not," as in the A.V.
and R.V. The same motion, looked at from opposite
sides, may be described in turning to and turning
from. Forsaking other confidences is part of the
process of making God one's trust. But it is significant
that the antithesis is not completely carried out, for
those to whom the trustful heart does not turn are not
here, as might have been expected, rival objects of
trust, but those who put their own trust in false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
refuges. "The proud" are the class of arrogantly
self-reliant people who feel no need of anything but
their own strength to lean on. "Deserters to a lie"
are those who fall away from Jehovah to put their trust
in any creature, since all refuges but Himself will fail.
Idols may be included in this thought of <i>a lie</i>, but it is
unduly limited if confined to them. Much rather it
takes in all false grounds of security. The antithesis
fails in accuracy, for the sake of putting emphasis on
the prevalence of such mistaken trust, which makes it
so much the harder to keep aloof from the multitudes
and stand alone in reliance on Jehovah.</p>

<p>Ver. 5 corresponds with ver. 4, in that it sets forth
in similar generality the great deeds with which God
is wont to answer man's trust. But the personality
of the poet breaks very beautifully through the impersonal
utterances at two points: once when he names
Jehovah as "my God," thus claiming his separate
share in the general mercies and his special bond of
connection with the Lover of all; and once when
he speaks of his own praises, thus recognising the
obligation of individual gratitude for general blessings.
Each particle of finely comminuted moisture in the
rainbow has to flash back the broad sunbeam at its
own angle. God's "wonders and designs" are "realised
Divine thoughts and Divine thoughts which are
gradually being realised" (Delitzsch). These are
wrought and being wrought in multitudes innumerable;
and, as the psalmist sees the bright, unbroken beams
pouring forth from their inexhaustible source, he breaks
into an exclamation of adoring wonder at the incomparable
greatness of the ever-giving God. "There
is none to set beside Thee" is far loftier and more
accordant with the tone of the verse than the comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
flat and incongruous remark that God's mercies
cannot be told to Him (A.V. and R.V.). A precisely
similar exclamation occurs in Psalm lxxi. 19, in which
God's incomparable greatness is deduced from the great
things which He has done. Happy the singer who
has an inexhaustible theme! He is not silenced by
the consciousness of the inadequacy of his songs, but
rather inspired to the never-ending, ever-beginning,
joyful task of uttering some new fragment of that
transcendent perfection. Innumerable wonders wrought
should be met by ever-new songs. If they cannot be
counted, the more reason for open-eyed observance
of them as they come, and for a stream of praise as
unbroken as is their bright continuance.</p>

<p>If God's mercies thus baffle enumeration and beggar
praise, the question naturally rises, "What shall I
render to the Lord for all His benefits?" Therefore the
next turn of thought shows the psalmist as reaching
the lofty spiritual conception that heartfelt delight in
God's will is the true response to God's wonders of love.
He soars far above external rites as well as servile obedience
to unloved authority, and proclaims the eternal
and ultimate truth that what God delights in is man's
delight in His will. The great words which rang the
knell of Saul's kingship may well have sounded in
his successor's spirit. Whether they are the source of
the language of our psalm or not, they are remarkably
similar. "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken
than the fat of rams" (1 Sam. xv. 23), teaches precisely
the same lesson as vv. 6-8 of this psalm. The strong
negation in ver. 6 does not deny the Divine institution
of the sacrificial law, but affirms that something much
deeper than external sacrifices is the real object of God's
desire. The negation is made emphatic by enumerating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the chief kinds of sacrifice. Whether they are bloody
or bloodless, whether meant to express consecration
or to effect reconciliation, they are none of them the
true sacrifices of God. In ver. 6 the psalmist is entirely
occupied with God's declarations of His requirements;
and he presents these in a remarkable fashion, intercalating
the clause, "Ears hast Thou pierced for me,"
between the two parallel clauses in regard to sacrifice.
Why should the connection be thus broken? The
fact that God has endowed the psalmist with capacity
to apprehend the Divine speech reveals God's desire
concerning him. Just because he has ears to hear, it
is clear that God wishes him to hear, and therefore
that outward acts of worship cannot be the acknowledgment
of mercies in which God delights. The
central clause of the verse is embedded in the others,
because it deals with a Divine act which, pondered,
will be seen to establish their teaching. The whole
puts in simple, concrete form a wide principle, namely,
that the possession of capacity for receiving communications
of God's will imposes the duty of loving reception
and obedience, and points to inward joyful acceptance
of that will as the purest kind of worship.</p>

<p>Vv. 7 and 8 are occupied with the response to God's
requirements thus manifested by His gift of capacity to
hear His voice. "Then said I." As soon as he had
learned the meaning of his ears he found the right use
of his tongue. The thankful heart was moved to swift
acceptance of the known will of God. The clearest
recognition of His requirements may coexist with
resistance to them, and needs the impulse of loving
contemplation of God's unnumbered wonders to vivify
it into glad service. "Behold, I am come," is the
language of a servant entering his master's presence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
obedience to his call. In ver. 7 the second clause
interrupts just as in ver. 6. There the interruption
spoke of the organ of receiving Divine messages as to
duty; here it speaks of the messages themselves: "In
the roll of the book is my duty prescribed for me."
The promise implied in giving ears is fulfilled by giving
a permanent written law. This man, having ears to
hear, has heard, and has not only heard, but welcomed
into the inmost recesses of his heart and will, the
declared will of God. The word rendered "delight"
in ver. 8 is the same as is rendered "desire" in ver. 6
(A.V.); and that rendered by the A.V. and R.V. in
ver. 8 "will" is properly "good pleasure." Thus God's
delight and man's coincide. Thankful love assimilates
the creature's will with the Divine, and so changes
tastes and impulses that desire and duty are fused into
one. The prescriptions of the book become the delight
of the heart. An inward voice directs. "Love, and
do what Thou wilt"; for a will determined by love cannot
but choose to please its Beloved. Liberty consists
in freely willing and victoriously doing what we ought,
and such liberty belongs to hearts whose supreme
delight is to please the God whose numberless wonders
have won their love and made their thanksgivings poor.
The law written in the heart was the ideal even when
a law was written on tables of stone. It was the
prophetic promise for the Messianic age. It is fulfilled
in the Christian life in the measure of its genuineness.
Unless the heart delights in the law, acts of obedience
count for very little.</p>

<p>The quotation of vv. 7, 8, in Heb. x. 5-7, is mainly
from the LXX., which has the remarkable rendering of
ver. 6 <i>b</i>, "A body hast Thou prepared for me." Probably
this is meant as paraphrase rather than as translation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and it does represent substantially the idea of the
original, since the body is the instrument for fulfilling,
just as the ear is the organ for apprehending, the uttered
will of God. The value of the psalm for the writer of
Hebrews does not depend on that clause, but on the
whole representation which it gives of the ideal of the
perfectly righteous servant's true worship, as involving
the setting aside of sacrifice and the decisive pre-eminence
of willing obedience. That ideal is fulfilled
in Jesus, and really pointed onwards to Him. This
use of the quotation does not imply the directly
Messianic character of the psalm.</p>

<p>"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaketh," and thus the passage is easy from inward
delight in God's will to public declaration of His character.
Every true lover of God is a witness of His
sweetness to the world. Since the psalmist had His
law hidden in the depths of his being, he could not
"hide" His righteousness within his heart, but must
magnify it with his tongue. That is a feeble and
doubtful love which knows no necessity of utterance.
To "love and be silent" is sometimes imperative, but
always burdensome; and a heart happy in its love
cannot choose but ripple out in music of speech. The
psalmist describes himself as a messenger of glad
tidings, a true evangelist. The multiplicity of names
for the various aspects of God's character and acts
which he heaps together in these verses serves to
indicate their manifoldness, which he delighted to contemplate,
and his long, loving familiarity with them.
He sets his treasure in all lights, and views it from all
points, as a man will turn a jewel in his hand and get
a fresh flash from every facet. "Righteousness," the
good news that the Ruler of all is inflexibly just, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
a justice which scrupulously meets all creatures' needs
and becomes penal and awful only to the rejecters of its
tender aspect; "faithfulness," the inviolable adherence
to every promise; "salvation," the actual fulness of
deliverance and well-being flowing from these attributes;
"loving-kindness" and "troth," often linked together
as expressing at once the warmth and the unchangeableness
of the Divine heart&mdash;these have been the
psalmist's themes. Therefore they are his hope; and
he is sure that, as he has been their singer, they will be
his preservers. Ver. 11 is not prayer, but bold confidence.
It echoes the preceding verse, since "I did
not restrain" (ver. 9) corresponds with "Thou wilt
not restrain," and "Thy loving-kindness and Thy
troth" with the mention of the same attributes in ver.
10. The psalmist is not so much asserting his claims
as giving voice to his faith. He does not so much
think that his utterance is deserving of remuneration as
that God's character makes impossible the supposition
that he, who had so loved and sung His great name in
its manifold glories, should find that name unavailing
in his hour of need.</p>

<p>There is an undertone of such felt need even in the
confidence of ver. 11; and it becomes dominant from
ver. 12 to the end, but not so as to overpower the clear
note of trust. The difference between the two parts
of the psalm is great, but is not to be exaggerated as if
it were contrariety. In the former part thanksgiving
for deliverance from dangers recently past predominates;
in the latter, petition for deliverance from
dangers still threatening: but in both the psalmist
is exercising the same confidence; and if in the
beginning he hymns the praises of God who brought
him out of the pit of destruction, in the end he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
keeps firm hold of Him as His "Help and Deliverer."
Similarly, while in the first portion he celebrates the
"purposes which are to usward," in the latter he is
certain that, needy as he is, Jehovah has "purposes" of
kindness to him. The change of tone is not so complete
as to negative the original unity, and surely it is not
difficult to imagine a situation in which both halves of
the psalm should be appropriate. Are there any
deliverances in this perilous and incomplete life so
entire and permanent that they leave no room for
future perils? Must not prevision of coming dangers
accompany thankfulness for past escapes? Our
Pharaohs are seldom drowned in the Red Sea, and
we do not often see their corpses stretched on the sand.
The change of tone, of which so much use is made as
against the original unity of the psalm, begins with ver.
12; but that verse has a very strong and beautiful link
of connection with the previous part, in the description
of besetting evils as innumerable. Both words of ver. 5
are repeated, that for "surpass" or "are more than"
in ver. 12 <i>c</i>, that for "number" in <i>a</i>. The heart that
has felt how innumerable are God's thoughts and deeds
of love is not utterly reduced to despair, even while it
beholds a sea of troubles rolling its white-crested
billows shoreward as far as the horizon. The sky
stretches beyond them, and the true numberlessness
of God's mercies outdoes the great yet really limited
range of apparently numberless sins or sorrows, the
consequences of sin. "Mine iniquities have overtaken
me" like pursuing foes, and every calamity that
held him in its grip was a child of a sin of his. Such
consciousness of transgression is not inconsistent with
"delight in the law of God after the inward man," as
Paul found out (Rom. vii. 22, 23), but it sets aside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
attempt to make this a directly Messianic psalm. "I am
not able to see." Such is the only possible rendering,
for there is no justification for translating the simple
word by "look up." Either the crowd of surrounding
calamities prevent the psalmist from seeing anything
but themselves, or, more probably, the failure of vital
power accompanying his sorrow dims his vision (Psalm
xxxviii. 10).</p>

<p>From ver. 13 onwards Psalm lxx. repeats this psalm,
with unimportant verbal differences. The first of these
is the omission of "Be pleased" in ver. 13, which binds
this second part to the first, and points back to "Thy
pleasure" (ver. 8). The prayer for the confusion of
enemies closely resembles that in Psalm xxxv., ver. 14
being almost identical with vv. 4 and 26 there, and
ver. 15 recalling ver. 21 of that psalm. The prayer
that enemies may fail in their designs is consistent
with the most Christlike spirit, and nothing more
is asked by the psalmist, but the tinge of satisfaction
with which he dwells on their discomfiture, however
natural, belongs to the less lofty moral standard of his
stage of revelation. He uses extraordinarily forcible
words to paint their bewilderment and mortification&mdash;may
they blush, turn pale, be driven back, be as if
paralysed with shame at their baffled malice! The
prayer for the gladness of God's servants and seekers
is like Psalm xxxv. 27. It asks that fruition as complete
as the disappointment of the foes may be the lot
of those whose desires set towards God, and it is prophecy
as well as prayer. Seekers after God ever find
Him, and are more joyful in possession than they hoped
to be while seeking. He alone never eludes search,
nor ever disappoints attainment. They who long for
His salvation will receive it; and their reception will fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
their hearts so full of blessedness that their lips will
not be able to refrain from ever-new outbursts of the
old praise, "The Lord be magnified."</p>

<p>Very plaintively and touchingly does the low sigh of
personal need follow this triumphant intercession for the
company of the saints. Its triple elements blend in
one believing aspiration, which is not impatience, though
it pleads for swift help. "I am afflicted and needy";
there the psalmist turns his eye on his own sore necessity.
"Jehovah has purposes for me"; there he turns
to God, and links his final petitions with his earlier
trust by the repetition of the word by which he described
(ver. 5) the many gracious designs of God. "My God,
delay not"; there he embraces both in one act of faithful
longing. His need calls for, and God's loving counsels
ensure, swift response. He who delights when an
afflicted and poor man calls Him "my God" will not
be slack to vindicate His servant's confidence, and
magnify His own name. That appeal goes straight to
the heart of God.</p>

<p>The central mass of this psalm describes the
singer as suffering from two evils: sickness and
treacherous friends. This situation naturally leads up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to the prayer and confidence of the closing strophe
(vv. 10-12). But its connection with the introductory
verses (1-3) is less plain. A statement of the blessings
ensured to the compassionate seems a singular introduction
to the psalmist's pathetic exhibition of his
sorrows. Cheyne thinks that the opening verses were
added by the framer of the collection to adapt the poem
to the use of the Church of his own time, and that
"the original opening must have been different" ("Orig.
of Psalt.," 246, <i>n.</i>). It is to be observed, however, that
the two points of the psalmist's affliction are the two
from which escape is assured to the compassionate, who
shall not be "delivered to the desire of his enemies,"
and shall be supported and healed in sickness. Probably,
therefore, the general promises of vv. 1-3 are
silently applied by the psalmist to himself; and he is
comforting his own sorrow with the assurance which
in his humility he casts into impersonal form. He has
been merciful, and believes, though things look dark,
that he will obtain mercy. There is probably also an
intentional contrast with the cruel exacerbation of his
sufferings by uncompassionate companions, which has
rubbed salt into his wounds. He has a double consciousness
in these opening verses, inasmuch as he
partly thinks of himself as the compassionate man and
partly as the "weak" one who is compassionated.</p>

<p>The combination of sickness and treachery is remarkable,
especially if the former is taken literally, as the
strongly marked details seem to require. The sick man
is visited by an insincere sympathiser, who is all eyes to
note symptoms of increasing weakness, and all tongue,
as soon as he gets out of the sick-room, to give the
result, which is to his malice the better the worse it is.
Such a picture looks as if drawn from life, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
sketch of the traitor friend seems to be a portrait of a
real person. The supporters of the post-exilic date
and national interpretation of the psalm have not succeeded
in pointing out who the false friends of Israel
were, who seemed to condole with, and really rejoiced
over, its weakness, or who were the treacherous allies
who failed it. The theory of the Davidic origin
has in its favour the correspondence of Ahithophel's
treason with the treachery of the trusted friend in the
psalm; and, while it must be admitted that there is no
mention of sickness in the narrative in 2 Samuel, the
supposition that trouble of conscience had brought illness
gains some countenance from Psalm xxxii., if it is
Davidic, and would naturally explain David's singular
passiveness whilst Absalom was hatching his plot.</p>

<p>The psalm may be divided into four strophes, of
which, however, the two middle ones cohere very
closely. Vv. 1-3 give the mercy requited to the
merciful; vv. 4-6, after a brief prayer and confession
begin the picture of the psalmist's sufferings, which is
carried on through the next strophe (vv. 7-9), with
the difference that in the former the scene is mainly
the sick man's chamber, and in the latter the meeting-place
of the secret conspirators. Vv. 10-12 build on
this picture of distress a prayer for deliverance, and
rise to serene confidence in its certain answer. The
closing doxology is not part of the psalm, but is
appended as the conclusion of the first book of the
Psalter.</p>

<p>The principle that God's dealings with us correspond
to our dealings with men, as clouds are moulded after
the curves of the mountains which they touch, is no
less characteristic of the New Testament than of the
Old. The merciful obtain mercy; God forgives those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
who forgive their brethren. The absoluteness of statement
in this psalm is, of course, open to misunderstanding;
but the singer had not such a superficial view of
his relations to God as to suppose that kindly sympathy
was the sole condition of Divine compassion. That
virtue, the absence of which added pangs to his pains,
might well seem to a sufferer writhing under the bitterness
of its opposite the Divinest of all excellencies, and
worthiest of recompense. That its requital should be
mainly considered as consisting in temporal deliverance
and physical health is partly due to the characteristics
of the Old Testament promises of blessedness, and
partly to the psalmist's momentary needs. We have
noted that these are reflected in the blessings promised
in vv. 1-3. The "happy" of ver. 1 is caught up in
the abruptly introduced "He shall be counted happy"
of ver. 2, which may carry tacit reference to the
malicious slanders that aggravated the psalmist's sufferings,
and anticipates deliverance so perfect that all who
see him shall think him fortunate. The next clause
rises into direct address of Jehovah, and is shown by
the form of the negative in the Hebrew to be petition,
not assertion, thus strongly confirming the view that
"me" lurks below "him" in this context. A similar
transition from the third to the second person occurs in
ver. 3, as if the psalmist drew closer to his God. There
is also a change of tense in the verbs there: "Jehovah
<i>will</i> sustain"; "Thou <i>hast</i> turned," the latter tense
converting the general truth expressed in the former
clause into a fact of experience. The precise meaning
of this verse is questioned, some regarding both clauses
as descriptive of tender nursing, which sustains the
drooping head and smoothes the crumpled bedding,
while others, noting that the word rendered "bed"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
(A.V. and R.V.) in the second clause means properly
"lying down," take that clause as descriptive of
turning sickness into convalescence. The latter meaning
gives a more appropriate ending to the strophe,
as it leaves the sick man healed, not tossing on a
disordered bed, as the other explanation does. Jehovah
does not half cure.</p>

<p>The second and third strophes (vv. 4-9) are closely
connected. In them the psalmist recounts his sorrows
and pains, but first breathes a prayer for mercy, and
bases it no longer on his mercifulness, but on his sin.
Only a shallow experience will find contradiction here
to either the former words, or to the later profession of
"integrity" (ver. 12). The petition for soul-healing
does not prove that sickness in the following verses is
figurative, but results from the belief that sorrow is
the effect of sin, a view which belongs to the psalmist's
stage of revelation, and is not to be held by Christians
in the same absolute fashion. If the Davidic origin of
the psalm is recognised, the connection of the king's
great sin with all his after-sorrows is patent. However
he had been merciful and compassionate in general, his
own verdict on the man in Nathan's parable was that
he "showed no pity," and that sin bore bitter fruit in
all his life. It was the parent of all the sensual outrages
in his own house; it underlay Ahithophel's treachery;
it had much to do in making his reign abhorred; it
brought the fuel which Absalom fired, and if our supposition
is right as to the origin of the sickness spoken of
in this psalm, that sin and the remorse that followed it
gnawed at the roots of bodily health. So the psalmist,
if he is indeed the royal sinner, had need to pray for
soul-healing first, even though he was conscious of
much compassion and hoped for its recompense. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
he speaks thus to Jehovah, his enemies speak in a
different tone. The "evil" which they utter is not
calumny, but malediction. Their hatred is impatient
for his death. The time seems long till they can hear
of it. One of them comes on a hypocritical visit of
solicitude ("see" is used for visiting the sick in
2 Kings viii. 29), and speaks lying condolence, while
he greedily collects encouraging symptoms that the
disease is hopeless. Then he hurries back to tell how
much worse he had found the patient; and that ignoble
crew delight in the good news, and send it flying.
This very special detail goes strongly in favour of the
view that we have in this whole description a transcript
of literal, personal experience. There were plenty of
concealed enemies round David in the early stages of
Absalom's conspiracy, who would look eagerly for signs
of his approaching death, which might save the need
of open revolt and plunge the kingdom into welcome
confusion. The second strophe ends with the exit of
the false friend.</p>

<p>The third (vv. 7-9) carries him to the meeting-place
of the plotters, who eagerly receive and retail the good
news that the sick man is worse. They feed their
ignoble hate by picturing further ill as laying hold of
him. Their wish is parent to their thought, which is
confirmed by the report of their emissary. "A thing
of Belial is poured out on him," or "is fastened upon
him," say they. That unusual expression may refer
either to moral or physical evil. In the former sense
it would here mean the sufferer's sin, in the latter
a fatal disease. The connection makes the physical
reference the more likely. This incurable disease is
conceived of as "poured out," or perhaps as "molten
on him," so that it cannot be separated from him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Therefore he will never rise from his sick-bed. But
even this murderous glee is not the psalmist's sharpest
pang. "The man of my peace," trusted, honoured,
admitted to the privileges, and therefore bound by the
obligations, of hospitality so sacred in the old world,
has kicked the prostrate sufferer, as the ass in the fable
did the sick lion. The treachery of Ahithophel at once
occurs to mind. No doubt many treacherous friends
have wounded many trustful hearts, but the correspondence
of David's history with this detail is not to
be got rid of by the observation that treachery is
common. Still less is it sufficient to quote Obad. 7,
where substantially the same language is employed
in reference to the enemies of Edom, as supporting the
national reference of the present passage. No one
denies that false allies may be described by such
a figure, or that nations may be personified; but is
there any event in the post-exilic history which shows
Israel deceived and spurned by trusted allies? The
Davidic authorship and the personal reference of the
psalm are separable. But if the latter is adopted, it
will be hard to find any circumstances answering so
fully to the details of the psalm as the Absalomic
rebellion and Ahithophel's treason. Our Lord's quotation
of part of ver. 9, with the significant omission of
"in whom I trusted," does not imply the Messianic
character of the psalm, but is an instance of an event
and a saying which were not meant as prophetic,
finding fuller realisation in the life of the perfect type
of suffering godliness than in the original sufferer.</p>

<p>The last strophe (vv. 10-12) recurs to prayer, and
soars to confidence born of communion. A hand
stretched out in need and trust soon comes back filled
with blessings. Therefore here the moment of true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
petition is the moment of realised answer. The prayer
traverses the malicious hopes of enemies. They had
said, "He will rise no more"; it prays, "Raise me up."
It touches a note which sounds discordant in the desire
"that I may requite them"; and it is far more truly
reverential and appreciative of the progress of revelation
to recognise the relative inferiority of the psalmist's
wish to render <i>quid pro quo</i> than to put violence on
his words, in order to harmonise them with Christian
ethics, or to slur over the distinction between the Law,
of which the keynote was retribution, and the Gospel,
of which it is forgiveness.</p>

<p>But the last words of the psalm are sunny with the
assurance of present favour and with boundless hope.
The man is still lying on his sick-bed, ringed by
whispering foes. There is no change without, but this
change has passed: that he has tightened his hold of
God, and therefore can feel that his enemies' whispers
will never rise or swell into a shout of victory over him.
He can speak of the future deliverance as if present;
and he can look ahead over an indefinite stretch of
sunlit country, scarcely knowing whether the furthest
point is earth or no. His integrity is not sinless, nor
does he plead it as a reason for Jehovah's upholding,
but hopes for it as the consequence of His sustaining
hand. He knows that he will have close approach to
Jehovah; and though, no doubt, "for ever" on his
lips meant less than it does on ours, his assurance of
continuous communion with God reached, if not to
actual, clear consciousness of immortality, at all events
to assurance of a future so indefinitely extended, and
so brightened by the sunlight of God's face, that it

<p>The second book of the Psalter is characterised by
the use of the Divine name "Elohim" instead of
"Jehovah." It begins with a cluster of seven psalms
(reckoning Psalms xlii. and xliii. as one) of which the
superscription is most probably regarded as ascribing
their authorship to "the sons of Korach." These were
Levites, and (according to 1 Chron. ix. 19 <i>seq.</i>) the
office of keepers of the door of the sanctuary had been
hereditary in their family from the time of Moses.
Some of them were among the faithful adherents of
David at Ziklag (1 Chron. xii. 6), and in the new model
of worship inaugurated by him the Korachites were
doorkeepers and musicians. They retained the former
office in the second Temple (Neh. xi. 19). The ascription
of authorship to a group is remarkable, and has
led to the suggestion that the superscription does not
specify the authors, but the persons for whose use the
psalms in question were composed. The Hebrew
would bear either meaning; but if the latter is adopted,
all these psalms are anonymous. The same construction
is found in Book I. in Psalms xxv.-xxviii., xxxv.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
xxxvii., where it is obviously the designation of
authorship, and it is naturally taken to have the same
force in these Korachite psalms. It has been ingeniously
conjectured by Delitzsch that the Korachite
Psalms originally formed a separate collection entitled
"Songs of the Sons of Korach," and that this title afterwards
passed over into the superscriptions when they
were incorporated in the Psalter. It may have been so,
but the supposition is unnecessary. It was not exactly
literary fame which psalmists hungered for. The
actual author, as one of a band of kinsmen who worked
and sang together, would, not unnaturally, be content to
sink his individuality and let his song go forth as that
of the band. Clearly the superscriptions rested upon
some tradition or knowledge, else defective information
would not have been acknowledged as it is in this one;
but some name would have been coined to fill the gap.</p>

<p>The two psalms (xlii., xliii.) are plainly one. The
absence of a title for the second, the identity of tone
throughout, the recurrence of several phrases, and
especially of the refrain, put this beyond doubt. The
separation, however, is old, since it is found in the LXX.
It is useless to speculate on its origin.</p>

<p>There is much in the psalms which favours the hypothesis
that the author was a Korachite companion of
David's in his flight before Absalom; but the locality,
described as that of the singer, does not entirely correspond
to that of the king's retreat, and the description
of the enemies is not easily capable of application in all
points to his foes. The house of God is still standing;
the poet has been there recently, and hopes soon to
return and render praise. Therefore the psalm must
be pre-exilic; and while there is no certainty attainable
as to date, it may at least be said that the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of the singer present more points of contact
with those of the supposed Korachite follower of
David's fortunes on the uplands across Jordan than
with those of any other of the imaginary persons to
whom modern criticism has assigned the poem. Whoever
wrote it has given immortal form to the longings
of the soul after God. He has fixed for ever and made
melodious a sigh.</p>

<p>The psalm falls into three parts, each closing with
the same refrain. Longings and tears, remembrances of
festal hours passed in the sanctuary melt the singer's
soul, while taunting enemies hiss continual sarcasms at
him as forsaken by his God. But his truer self silences
these lamentations, and cheers the feebler "soul" with
clear notes of trust and hope, blown in the refrain, like
some trumpet-clang rallying dispirited fugitives to the
fight. The stimulus serves for a moment; but once
more courage fails, and once more, at yet greater length
and with yet sadder tones, plaints and longings are
wailed forth. Once more, too, the higher self repeats
its half-rebuke, half-encouragement. So ends the first
of the psalms; but obviously it is no real ending, for
the victory over fear is not won, and longing has
not become blessed. So once more the wave of
emotion rolls over the psalmist, but with a new aspect
which makes all the difference. He prays now; he
had only remembered and complained and said that he
would pray before. Therefore now he triumphs, and
though he still is keenly conscious of his enemies, they
appear but for a moment, and, though he still feels that
he is far from the sanctuary, his heart goes out in
hopeful visions of the gladness of his return thither,
and he already tastes the rapture of the joy that will
then flood his heart. Therefore the refrain comes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
a third time; and this time the longing, trembling soul
continues at the height to which the better self has
lifted it, and silently acknowledges that it need not
have been cast down. Thus the whole song is a
picture of a soul climbing, not without backward slips,
from the depths to the heights, or, in another aspect,
of the transformation of longing into certainty of
fruition, which is itself fruition after a kind.</p>

<p>Perhaps the singer had seen, during his exile on the
eastern side of Jordan, some gentle creature, with open
mouth and heaving flanks, eagerly seeking in dry
wadies for a drop of water to cool her outstretched
tongue; and the sight had struck on his heart as an
image of himself longing for the presence of God in the
sanctuary. A similar bit of local colour is generally
recognised in ver. 7. Nature reflects the poet's moods,
and overmastering emotion sees its own analogues
everywhere. That lovely metaphor has touched the
common heart as few have done, and the solitary
singer's plaint has fitted all devout lips. Injustice is
done it, if it is regarded merely as the longing of a
Levite for approach to the sanctuary. No doubt the
psalmist connected communion with God and presence
in the Temple more closely together than they should
do who have heard the great charter, "neither in this
mountain, nor in Jerusalem"; but, however the two
things were coupled in his mind, they were sufficiently
separate to allow of approach by longing and prayer
while distant in body, and the true object of yearning
was not access to the Temple, but communion with the
God of the Temple.</p>

<p>The "soul" is feminine in Hebrew, and is here
compared to the female deer, for "pants" is the feminine
form of the verb, though its noun is masculine. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
better therefore to translate "hind" than "hart." The
"soul" is the seat of emotions and desires. It "pants"
and "thirsts," is "cast down" and disquieted; it is
"poured out"; it can be bidden to "hope." Thus
tremulous, timid, mobile, it is beautifully compared to a
hind. The true object of its longings is always God,
however little it knows for what it is thirsting. But
they are happy in their very yearnings who are
conscious of the true direction of these, and can say
that it is God for whom they are athirst. All unrest
of longing, all fever of thirst, all outgoings of desire,
are feelers put out blindly, and are only stilled when
they clasp Him. The correspondence between man's
needs and their true object is involved in that name
"the living God"; for a heart can rest only in one
all-sufficient Person, and must have a heart to throb
against. Neither abstractions nor dead things can still
its cravings. That which does must be living. But
no finite being can still them; and after all sweetnesses
of human loves and helps of human strengths, the
soul's thirst remains unslaked, and the Person who is
enough must be the living God. The difference between
the devout and the worldly man is just that the one
can only say, "My soul pants and thirsts," and the
other can add "after Thee, O God."</p>

<p>This man's longing was intensified by his unwilling
exile from the sanctuary, a special privation to a door-keeper
of the Temple. His situation and mood closely
resemble those in another Korachite psalm (lxxxiv.),
in which, as here, the soul "faints for the courts of
the Lord," and as here the panting hind, so there the
glancing swallows flitting about the eaves are woven
into the song. Unnamed foes taunt the psalmist with
the question, "Where is thy God?" There is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
necessity to conclude that these were heathens, though
the taunt is usually put into heathen lips (Psalms lxxix.
10; lii. 2) but it would be quite as natural from
co-religionists, flouting his fervour and personal grasp
of God and taking his sorrows as tokens of God's
abandonment of him. That is the world's way with
the calamities of a devout man, whose humble cry, "My
God," it resents as presumption or hypocrisy.</p>

<p>But even these bitter sarcasms are less bitter than the
remembrance of "happier things," which is his "sorrow's
crown of sorrow." Yet, with the strange but universal
love of summoning up remembrance of departed joys,
the psalmist finds a certain pleasure in the pain of
recalling how he, a Levite, led the festal march to the
Temple, and in listening in fancy again to the shrill cries
of joy which broke from the tumultuous crowd. The
form of the verbs "remember" and "pour out" in
ver. 4 indicates set purpose.</p>

<p>The higher self arrests this flow of self-pity and
lamentation. The feminine soul has to give account
of her moods to calmer judgment, and to be lifted and
steadied by the strong spirit. The preceding verses
have given ample reason why she has been dejected,
but now she is summoned to repeat them to a judicial
ear. The insufficiency of the circumstances described
to warrant the vehement emotions expressed is implied
in the summons. Feeling has to vindicate its rationality
or to suppress itself, and its grounds have often
only to be stated to the better self, to be found altogether
disproportioned to the storm they have raised. It is
a very elementary but necessary lesson for the conduct
of life that emotion of all sorts, sad or glad, religious
or other, needs rigid scrutiny and firm control, sometimes
stimulating and sometimes chilling. The true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
counterpoise to its excess lies in directing it to God
and in making Him the object of hope and patient
waiting. Emotion varies, but God is the same. The
facts on which faith feeds abide while faith fluctuates.
The secret of calm is to dwell in that inner chamber
of the secret place of the Most High, which whoso
inhabits "heareth not the loud winds when they call,"
and is neither dejected nor uplifted, neither disturbed
by excessive joys nor torn by anxieties.</p>

<p>Ver. 5 has the refrain in a form slightly different
from that of the other two instances of its occurrence
(ver. 11 and xliii. 5). But probably the text is faulty.
The shifting of the initial word of ver. 6 to the end of
ver. 5, and the substitution of <i>My</i> for <i>His</i>, bring the
three refrains into line, and avoid the harsh expression
"help of His countenance." Since no reason for
the variation is discernible, and the proposed slight
change of text improves construction and restores uniformity,
it is probably to be adopted. If it is, the second
part of the psalm is also conformed to the other two in
regard to its not beginning with the Divine name.</p>

<p>The break in the clouds is but momentary, and the
grey wrack fills the sky once more. The second part
of the psalm takes up the question of the refrain, and
first reiterates with bitter emphasis that the soul is
bowed down, and then pours out once more the stream
of reasons for dejection. But the curb has not been
applied quite in vain, for throughout the succeeding
verses there is a striking alternation of despondency
and hope. Streaks of brightness flash through the
gloom. Sorrow is shot with trust. This conflict of
opposite emotions is the characteristic of the second
part of the psalm, while that of the first part is an all
but unrelieved predominance of gloom, and that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the third an all but undisputed victory of sunshine.
Naturally this transition strophe is marked by the
mingling of both. In the former part, memory was
the handmaid of sorrow, and came involuntarily, and
increased the singer's pain; but in this part he makes
an effort of will to remember, and in remembrance
finds an antidote to sorrow. To recall past joys adds
stings to present grief, but to remember God brings an
anodyne for the smart. The psalmist is far from the
sanctuary, but distance does not hinder thought. This
man's faith was not so dependent on externals that it
could not come close to God while distant from His
temple. It had been so far strengthened by the encouragement
of the refrain that the reflux of sadness at
once rouses it to action. "My soul is cast down; ...
<i>therefore</i> let me remember Thee." With wise resolve he
finds in dejection a reason for nestling closer to God.
In reference to the description of the psalmist's locality,
Cheyne beautifully says, "The preposition 'from' is
chosen (rather than 'in') with a subtle purpose. It
suggests that the psalmist's faith will bridge over the
interval between himself and the sanctuary: 'I can send
my thoughts to Thee from the distant frontier'" (<i>in loc.</i>).
The region intended seems to be "the north-eastern
corner of Palestine, near the lower slopes of Hermon"
(Cheyne, <i>u.s.</i>). The plural "Hermons" is probably
used in reference to the group of crests. "Mizar" is
probably the name of a hill otherwise unknown, and
specifies the singer's locality more minutely, though not
helpfully to us. Many ingenious attempts have been
made to explain the name either as symbolical or as a
common noun, and not a proper name, but these need
not be dealt with here. The locality thus designated
is too far north for the scene of David's retreat before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Absalom, unless we give an unusual southward extension
to the names; and this makes a difficulty in the
way of accepting the hypothesis of the author's having
been in his retinue.</p>

<p>The twofold emotions of ver. 6 recur in vv. 7, 8,
where we have first renewed despondency and then
reaction into hope. The imagery of floods lifting up
their voices, and cataracts sounding as they fall, and
breaking waves rolling over the half-drowned psalmist
has been supposed to be suggested by the scenery in
which he was; but the rushing noise of Jordan in its
rocky bed seems scarcely enough to deserve being
described as "flood calling to flood," and "breakers
and rollers" is an exaggeration if applied to any commotion
possible on such a stream. The imagery is so
usual that it needs no assumption of having been
occasioned by the poet's locality. The psalmist paints
his calamities as storming on him in dismal continuity,
each "flood" seeming to summon its successor. They
rush upon him, multitudinous and close following; they
pour down on him as with the thunder of descending
cataracts; they overwhelm him like the breakers and
rollers of an angry ocean. The bold metaphors are
more striking when contrasted with the opposite ones
of the first part. The dry and thirsty land there and
the rush of waters here mean the same thing, so
flexible is nature in a poet's hands.</p>

<p>Then follows a gleam of hope, like a rainbow spanning
the waterfall. With the alternation of mood already
noticed as characteristic, the singer looks forward, even
from the midst of overwhelming seas of trouble, to a
future day when God will give His angel, Mercy or
Loving-kindness, charge concerning him and draw him
out of many waters. That day of extrication will surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
be followed by a night of music and of thankful prayer
(for supplication is not the only element in prayer) to Him
who by His deliverance has shown Himself to be the
"God of" the rescued man's "life." The epithet answers
to that of the former part, "the living God," from which
it differs by but one additional letter. He who has life
in Himself is the Giver and Rescuer of our lives, and
to Him they are to be rendered in thankful sacrifice.
Once more the contending currents meet in vv. 9 and
10, in the former of which confidence and hope utter
themselves in the resolve to appeal to God and in the
name given to Him as "my Rock"; while another surge
of despondency breaks, in the question in which the
soul interrogates God, as the better self had interrogated
her, and contrasts almost reproachfully God's apparent
forgetfulness, manifested by His delay in deliverance,
with her remembrance of Him. It is not a question
asked for enlightenment's sake, but is an exclamation
of impatience, if not of rebuke. Ver. 10 repeats the
enemies' taunt, which is there represented as like
crushing blows which broke the bones. And then
once more above this conflict of emotion soars the clear
note of the refrain, summoning to self-command, calmness,
and unfaltering hope.</p>

<p>But the victory is not quite won, and therefore Psalm
xliii. follows. It is sufficiently distinct in tone to
explain its separation from the preceding, inasmuch as
it is prayer throughout, and the note of joy is dominant,
even while an undertone of sadness links it with the
previous parts. The unity is vouched by the considerations
already noticed, and by the incompleteness of
Psalm xlii. without such triumphant close and of
Psalm xliii. without such despondent beginning. The
prayer of vv. 1, 2, blends the two elements, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
at war in the second part; and for the moment the
darker is the more prominent. The situation is
described as in the preceding parts. The enemy is
called a "loveless nation." The word rendered "loveless"
is compounded of the negative prefix and the word
which is usually found with the meaning of "one
whom God favours," or visits with loving-kindness. It
has been much disputed whether its proper signification
is active (one who shows loving-kindness) or passive
(one who receives it). But, considering that loving-kindness
is in the Psalter mainly a Divine attribute, and
that, when a human excellence, it is regarded as derived
from and being the echo of experienced Divine mercy,
it is best to take the passive meaning as the principal,
though sometimes, as unmistakably here, the active is
more suitable. These loveless people are not further
defined, and may either have been Israelites or aliens.
Perhaps there was one "man" of special mischief
prominent among them, but it is not safe to treat that
expression as anything but a collective. Ver. 2 looks
back to xlii. 9, the former clause in each verse being
practically equivalent, and the second in xliii. being a
quotation of the second in ver. 9, with a variation in
the form of the verb to suggest more vividly the
picture of weary, slow, dragging gait, fit for a man clad
in mourning garb.</p>

<p>But the gloomier mood has shot its last bolt. Grief
which finds no fresh words is beginning to dry up.
The stage of mechanical repetition of complaints is
not far from that of cessation of them. So the higher
mood conquers at last, and breaks into a burst of
joyous petition, which passes swiftly into realisation
of the future joys whose coming shines thus far off.
Hope and trust hold the field. The certainty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
return to the Temple overbears the pain of absence
from it, and the vivid realisation of the gladness of
worshipping again at the altar takes the place of the
vivid remembrance of former festal approach thither.
It is the prerogative of faith to make pictures drawn
by memory pale beside those painted by hope. Light
and Troth&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Loving-kindness and Faithfulness in
fulfilling promises&mdash;are like two angels, despatched from
the presence-chamber of God, to guide with gentleness
the exile's steps. That is to say, because God is
mercy and faithfulness, the return of the psalmist to
the home of his heart is sure. God being what He
is, no longing soul can ever remain unsatisfied. The
actual return to the Temple is desired because thereby
new praise will be occasioned. Not mere bodily presence
there, but that joyful outpouring of triumph
and gladness, is the object of the psalmist's longing.
He began with yearning after the living God. In his
sorrow he could still think of Him at intervals as the
help of his countenance and call Him "my God." He
ends with naming Him "the gladness of my joy."
Whoever begins as he did will finish where he climbed.
The refrain is repeated for a third time, and is followed
by no relapse into sadness. The effort of faith should
be persistent, even if old bitternesses begin again and
"break the low beginnings of content"; for, even if the
wild waters burst through the dam once and again, they
do not utterly wash it away and there remains a
foundation on which it may be built up anew. Each
swing of the gymnast lifts him higher, until he is on
a level with a firm platform on which he can spring and
stand secure. Faith may have a long struggle with fear,
but it will have the last word, and that word will be
"the help of my countenance and my God."</p>

<p>Calvin says that the authorship of this psalm is
uncertain, but that it is abundantly clear that it
was composed by any one rather than David, and that
its plaintive contents suit best the time when the savage
tyranny of Antiochus raged. No period corresponds
to the situation which makes the background of the
psalm so completely as the Maccabean, for only then
could it be truly said that national calamities fell
because of the nation's rigid monotheism. Other
epochs have been thought of, so as to avoid the
necessity of recognising Maccabean psalms, but none
of them can be said to meet the conditions described in
the psalm. The choice lies between accepting the Maccabean
date and giving up the attempt to fix one at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Objections to that late date based upon the history of
the completion of the canon take for granted more
accurate and complete knowledge of a very obscure subject
than is possessed, and do not seem strong enough to
negative the indications arising from the very unique
fact, asserted in the psalm, that the nation was persecuted
for its faith and engaged in a religious war.
The psalm falls into four parts: a wistful look backwards
to days already "old," when God fought for them (vv.
1-8); a sad contrast in present oppression (vv. 9-16);
a profession of unfaltering national adherence to the
covenant notwithstanding all these ills (vv. 17-22); and
a fervent cry to a God who seems asleep to awake and
rescue His martyred people (vv. 23-26).</p>

<p>The first part (vv. 1-8) recalls the fact that shone
so brightly in all the past, the continual exercise of
Divine power giving victory to their weakness, and
builds thereon a prayer that the same law of His
providence might be fulfilled now. The bitter side of
the retrospect forces itself into consciousness in the
next part, but here Memory is the handmaid of Faith.
The whole process of the Exodus and conquest of
Canaan is gathered up as one great "work" of God's
hand. The former inhabitants of the land were uprooted
like old trees, to give room for planting the
"vine out of Egypt." Two stages in the settlement are
distinguished in ver. 2: first came the "planting" and
next the growth; for the phrase "didst spread them
forth" carries on the metaphor of the tree, and expresses
the extension of its roots and branches. The ascription
of victory to God is made more emphatic by the
negatives in ver. 3, which take away all credit of it
from the people's own weapons or strength. The
consciousness of our own impotence must accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
adequate recognition of God's agency in our deliverances.
The conceit of our own power blinds our vision of His
working hand. But what moved His power? No
merit of man's, but the infinite free grace of God's
heart. "The light of Thy face" is the symbol of
God's loving regard, and the deepest truth as to His
acts of favour is that they are the outcome of His
own merciful nature. He is His own motive. "Thou
hadst delight in them" is the ultimate word, leading us
into sacred abysses of self-existent and self-originated
Deity. The spirit, then, of Israel's history is contained
in these three thoughts: the positive assertion of God's
power as the reason for their victories; the confirmatory
negative, putting aside their own prowess; and the
tracing of all God's work for them solely to His
unmerited grace.</p>

<p>On this grand generalisation of the meaning of
past centuries a prayer is built for their repetition
in the prosaic present. The psalmist did not think
that God was nearer in some majestic past than
now. His unchangeableness had for consequence,
as he thought, continuous manifestation of Himself in
the same character and relation to His people. To-day
is as full of God as any yesterday. Therefore
ver. 4 begins with an emphatic recognition of the
constancy of the Divine nature in that strong expression
"Thou Thyself," and with an individualising
transition for a moment to the singular in "my King,"
in order to give most forcible utterance to the thought
that He was the same to each man of that generation
as He had been to the fathers. On that unchanging
relation rests the prayer, "Command salvations for
(lit. <i>of</i>) Jacob," as if a multitude of several acts of
deliverance stood before God, as servants waiting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
be sent on His errands. Just as God (Elohim) takes
the place of Jehovah in this second book of the Psalter,
so in it Jacob frequently stands for Israel. The prayer
is no sooner spoken than the confidence in its fulfilment
lifts the suppliant's heart buoyantly above present
defeat, which will in the next turn of thought
insist on being felt. Such is the magic of every act
of true appeal to God. However dark the horizon,
there is light if a man looks straight up. Thus this
psalmist breaks into anticipatory pæans of victory.
The vivid image of ver. 5 is taken from the manner
of fighting common to wild horned animals, buffaloes
and the like, who first prostrate their foe by their
fierce charge and then trample him. The individualising
"my" reappears in ver. 6, where the negation
that had been true of the ancestors is made his own
by the descendant. Each man must, as his own act,
appropriate the universal relation of God to men and
make God his God, and must also disown for himself
reliance on himself. So he will enter into participation
in God's victories. Remembrance of the victorious
past and confidence in a like victorious future blend
in the closing burst of praise and vow for its continuance,
which vow takes for granted the future
continued manifestation of deliverances as occasions for
uninterrupted thanksgivings. Well might some long-drawn,
triumphant notes from the instruments prolong
the impression of the jubilant words.</p>

<p>The song drops in the second part (vv. 9-16) from
these clear heights with lyric suddenness. The grim
facts of defeat and consequent exposure to mocking
laughter from enemies force themselves into sight, and
seem utterly to contradict the preceding verses. But
the first part speaks with the voice of faith, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
second with that of sense, and these two may sound in
very close sequence or even simultaneously. In ver. 9
the two verbs are united by the absence of "us" with
the first; and the difference of tense in the Hebrew
brings out the dependence of the second on the first, as
effect and cause. God's rejection is the reason for the
nation's disgrace by defeat. In the subsequent verses
the thoughts of rejection and disgrace are expanded, the
former in ver. 9 <i>b</i> to ver. 12, and the latter in vv. 13-16.
The poet paints with few strokes the whole disastrous
rout. We see the fated band going out to battle, with
no Pillar of Cloud or Ark of the Covenant at their head.
They have but their own weapons and sinews to depend
on&mdash;not, as of old, a Divine Captain. No description
of a fight under such conditions is needed, for it can
have only one issue; and so the next clause shows
panic-struck flight. Whoever goes into battle without
God comes out of it without victory. Next follows
plundering, as was the savage wont of these times, and
there is no force to oppose the spoilers. The routed
fugitives are defenceless and unresisting as sheep, and
their fate is to be devoured, or possibly the expression
"sheep for food" may be substantially equivalent to
"sheep for the slaughter" (ver. 22), and may refer to
the usual butchery of a defeated army. Some of them
are slain and others carried off as slaves. The precise
rendering of ver. 12 <i>b</i> is doubtful. Calvin, and, among
the moderns, Hitzig, Ewald, Delitzsch, Cheyne, take
it to mean "Thou didst not set their prices high."
Others, such as Hupfeld, Baethgen, etc., adhere to the
rendering, "Thou didst not increase [Thy wealth] by
their price." The general sense is clear, and as bold
as clear. It is almost sarcasm, directed against the
Divine dealings: little has He gained by letting His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
flock be devoured and scattered. Hupfeld attaches
to the bitter saying a deep meaning: namely, that the
"sale" did not take place "for the sake of profit or
other external worldly ends, as is the case with men,
but from higher disciplinary grounds of the Divine
government&mdash;namely, simply as punishment for their
sins, for their improvement." Rather it may indicate
the dishonour accruing to the God, according to the
ideas of the old world, when His votaries were defeated;
or it may be the bitter reflection, "We can be of little
worth in our Shepherd's eyes when He parts with us
so easily." If there is any hint of tarnish adhering to
the name of God by His people's defeat, the passage
to the second main idea of this part is the easier.</p>

<p>Defeat brings dishonour. The nearer nations, such
as Edomites, Ammonites, and other ancestral foes, are
ready with their gibes. The more distant peoples make
a proverb out of the tragedy, and nod their heads
in triumph and scorn. The cowering creature, in the
middle of this ring of mockers, is covered with shame
as he hears the babel of heartless jests at his expense,
and steals a glance at the fierce faces round him.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find historical facts corresponding
with this picture. Even if the feature of selling into
captivity is treated as metaphor, the rest of the picture
needs some pressure to be made to fit the conditions
of the Maccabean struggle, to which alone the subsequent
avowals of faithfulness to God as the cause of
calamity answer. For there were no such periods of
disgraceful defeat and utter devastation when once that
heroic revolt had begun. The third part of the psalm
is in full accord with the religious consciousness of that
Indian summer of national glories; but it must be
acknowledged that the state of things described in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
this second part does not fit quite smoothly into the
hypothesis of a Maccabean date.</p>

<p>The third part (vv. 17-22) brings closely together
professions of righteousness, which sound strangely
in Christian ears, and complaints of suffering, and closes
with the assertion that these two are cause and effect.
The sufferers are a nation of martyrs, and know themselves
to be so. This tone is remarkable when the
nation is the speaker; for though we find individuals
asserting innocence and complaining of undeserved
afflictions in many psalms, a declaration of national
conformity with the Law is in sharp contradiction both
to history and to the uniform tone of prophets. This
psalmist asserts not only national freedom from idolatry,
but adherence in heart and act to the Covenant. No
period before the exile was clear of the taint of idol
worship and yet darkened by calamity. We have no
record of any events before the persecutions that
roused the Maccabean struggle which answer to the
martyr cry of ver. 22: "For Thy sake we are killed
all the day." It may, indeed, be questioned what is
the relation in time of the two facts spoken of in
vv. 17-19. Which comes first, the calamity or the
steadfastness? Does the psalmist mean, "We are
afflicted, and yet we are in affliction true to God," or
"We were true to God, and yet are afflicted"?
Probably the latter, as in the remainder of this part.
"The place of jackals" is apparently the field of defeat
referred to in the second part, where obscene creatures
would gather to feast on the plundered corpses. The
Christian consciousness cannot appropriate the psalmist's
asseverations of innocence, and the difference between
them and it should not be slurred over. But, on the
other hand, his words should not be exaggerated into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
charges of injustice against God, nor claims of absolute
sinlessness. He does feel that present national distresses
have not the same origin as past ones had had.
There has been no such falling away as to account for
them. But he does not arraign God's government.
He knows why the miseries have come, and that he
and his fellows are martyrs. He does not fling that
fact down as an accusation of Providence, but as the
foundation of a prayer and as a plea for God's help. The
words may sound daring; still they are not blasphemy,
but supplication.</p>

<p>The fourth part is importunate prayer. Its frank
anthropomorphisms of a sleeping God, forgetting His
people, surely need little defence. Sleep withdraws
from knowledge of and action on the external world,
and hence is attributed to God, when He allows evils
to run unchecked. He is said to "awake," or, with
another figure, to "arise," as if starting from His throned
calm, when by some great act of judgment He smites
flourishing evil into nothingness. Injustice is surely
done to these cries of the <i>Ecclesia pressa</i> when they
are supposed to be in opposition to the other psalmist's
word: "He that keepeth Israel slumbers not, nor
sleeps." Some commentators call these closing petitions
commonplace; and so they are. Extreme need and
agony of supplication have other things to think of
than originality, and so long as sorrows are so
commonplace and like each other, the cries of the
sorrowful will be very much alike. God is pleased
with well-worn prayers, which have fitted many lips,
and is not so fastidious as some critics.</p>

<p>This is an epithalamion or ode on a king's
marriage. The usual bewildering variety of
conjectures as to his identity meets us in commentaries.
The older opinion points to Solomon's marriage to an
Egyptian princess, to which it is objected that he was
not a warrior king, as the monarch of the psalm is.
Hitzig regards "daughter of Tyre," in ver. 12, as a
vocative, and therefore looks for a king who married a
Tyrian woman. He is obliged to go to the northern
kingdom to find one, and pitches on Ahab, because
Jezebel was the daughter of "a king of the Zidonians,"
and Ahab had an "ivory house" (1 Kings xxii. 39).
It is hard to believe that that wedded pair of evil
memory are the originals of the lovely portraits in the
psalm, or that a psalmist would recognise the kingdom
of Israel as divinely established and to be eternally
upheld. Besides, the construction of ver. 12, on which
this theory pivots, is doubtful, and the daughter of
Tyre there mentioned is more probably one of the
bringers of gifts to the bride. The attributes of the
king and the promises for his descendants cannot be
extended, without incongruity, beyond the Davidic
line. Hence Delitzsch has selected Jehoram, the son
of Jehoshaphat, principally because his wife, Athaliah,
was of Tyrian descent, being Jezebel's daughter, and
partly because his father had been a trader, which
accounts for the allusions to gold of Ophir and ivory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
These are slender grounds of identification, to say
nothing of the miserable contrast which Jehoram's
reign&mdash;a dreary record of apostasy and defeat, culminating
in a tragic death and a dishonoured grave
(2 Chron. xxi.)&mdash;would present to the psalm. Some
commentators have thought of the marriage of a Persian
king, mainly because the peculiar word for <i>consort</i> in
ver. 9 is employed for Persian queens (Neh. ii. 6), and
also because the Tyrians were tributary to Persia, and
because the sons of the king are to be "called princes
in all lands," which reminds us of Persian satraps.
Ewald finally fixed on Jeroboam II. of Israel. Cheyne
("Orig. of Psalt.") finds the king of the psalm in Ptolemy
Philadelphus, the inspirer, as was believed, of the
LXX. translation, whom Josephus and Philo extol.
Its author puts this identification only as "tentative."
Notwithstanding his anticipatory protest against making
Philadelphus' moral character an objection, he feels
that it is an objection; for he urges that its darker
shades had not yet disclosed themselves, and confesses
that "a haze of illusion encompassed our poet," who
"overrated this Ptolemy, from taking too external a
view of the Messianic promise, and being flattered by
a Hellenic king's partiality for his people" (<i>u.s.</i>, 172).
Philadelphus afterwards married his sister. His hands
were red with blood. Was a Jewish psalmist likely to
take "up the singing robes of a court poet" (<i>u.s.</i>) in
honour of a Ptolemy, or to transfer the promises to the
Davidic line to, and to speak of God as the God of, a
foreign king? Or how, if he did, came his song to
find and keep a place in the Psalter? All these
conjectures show the hopelessness of identifying the
person intended addressed in the psalm. It is said
that a knowledge of the historical allusions in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Psalter is indispensable to enjoying it. They would
often be helpful if they could be settled, but that is
no reason for elevating conjecture to the place of
knowledge.</p>

<p>One reason for the failure of attempts at identification
is that the language is a world too wide for the best and
greatest of Jewish kings. Much in the psalm applies
to a historical occasion, the marriage of some monarch;
but there is much that as obviously goes beyond it.
Either, then, the psalm is hyperbole, outstripping even
poetical licence, or there appear in it characteristics
of the ideal monarch whom the psalmist knew to be
promised to Israel. Every king of Judah by descent
and office was a living prophecy. The singer sees
the Messiah shining, as it were, through the shadowy
form of the earthly king, whose limitations and defects,
no less than his excellences and glories, pointed onwards
to a greater than Solomon, in whom the "sure mercies"
promised to David should be facts at last.</p>

<p>The psalm has two main divisions, prefaced by a
prelude (ver. 1), and followed by prediction of happy
issue of the marriage and enduring and wide dominion.
The two main parts are respectively addressed to the
royal bridegroom (vv. 2-9) and to the bride (vv. 10-15).</p>

<p>The singer lays claim to at least <i>poetic</i> inspiration.
His heart is seething or boiling over with goodly
words, or perhaps with the joyful matter which
occasions his song&mdash;namely, the royal nuptials. He
dedicates his "work" (like the original meaning of
"poem"&mdash;a thing made) to "a king," the absence of
the definite article suggesting that the office is more
prominent than the person. He sings to a king; therefore
his strains must be lofty. So full is his heart
that the swift words pour out as the stylus of a rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
writer races over the parchment. The previous musing
has been long, the fire has burned slowly; but at last
all is molten, and rushes out, fluent because fervent.</p>

<p>The picture of the king begins with two features on
which the old-world ideal of a monarch laid stress&mdash;personal
beauty and gracious speech. This monarch
is fairer than the sons of men. The note of superhuman
excellence is struck at the outset; and though
the surface reference is only to physical beauty, that is
conceived of as the indication of a fair nature which
moulds the fair form.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For of the soul the body form doth take;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For soul is form, and doth the body make."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The highest truth of this opening word is realised
only in Him of whom it was also said, in apparent
contradiction, but real harmony with it, "His visage
was so marred more than any man, and His form more
than the sons of men." The craving for "whatsoever
things are lovely," like all other desires, has for its
object Jesus Christ. Another kingly excellence is sweet
courtesy of speech. Possibly, indeed, the "grace poured
on the lips" may mean the gracious smile which moulds
their curves, but more likely it refers to the kindly
speech that so well become a mouth that can command.
The sweetest examples of such words are poor beside
"the gracious words that proceeded out of His mouth."
The psalmist's ideal is that of a gentle king. Where
else than in the King whose sceptre was a reed, not an
iron rod, has it been fulfilled?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nor know we anything more fair<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Than is the smile upon Thy face."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From such characteristics the psalmist draws an
inference&mdash;"therefore God hath blessed thee for ever";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
for that "therefore" does not introduce the result of
the preceding excellences, but the cause of them. The
psalmist knows that God has blessed the king because
he sees these beauties. They are the visible signs and
tokens of the Divine benediction. In its reference to
Christ, the thought expressed is that His superhuman
beauty is to all men the proof of a unique operation
of God. Abiding divinity is witnessed by perfect
humanity.</p>

<p>The scene changes with startling suddenness to the
fury of battle. In a burst of lyric enthusiasm, forgetting
for a moment nuptials and wedding marches, the singer
calls on the king to array himself for war and to rush
on the foe. Very striking is this combination of gentleness
and warrior strength&mdash;a union which has been
often realised in heroic figures, which is needful for the
highest type of either, and which is fulfilled in the
Lamb of God, who is the Lion of the tribe of Judah.
The king is to gird on his sword, and to array himself,
as in glittering armour, in his splendour and majesty,
and, thus arrayed, to mount his chariot, or, less probably,
to bestride his war-horse, and hurl himself on
the yielding ranks of the enemy. "Press forward,
drive (or <i>ride</i>) on," crushing obstacles and forcing a
path. But Israel's king could be no vulgar conqueror,
impelled by lust of dominion or "glory." His sword
is to be girt on for the help or "on behalf of truth,
meekness, and righteousness." These abstracts may
be used for concretes&mdash;namely, the possessors of the
qualities named. But the limitation is not necessary.
The monarch's warfare is for the spread of these. The
Hebrew binds the two latter closely together by an
anomalous construction, which may be represented by
connecting the two words with a hyphen. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
regarded as a double star. Then follows a verse of
hurry: "Thy right hand shall teach thee awe-striking
deeds." He has no allies. The canvas has no room
for soldiers. The picture is like the Assyrian sculptures,
in which the king stands erect and alone in his chariot,
a giant in comparison with the tiny figures beneath
him. Like Rameses in Pentaur's great battle-song,
"he pierced the line of the foe; ... he was all alone,
no other with him." Then follow three abrupt clauses,
reflecting in their fragmentary character the stress of
battle: "Thine arrows are sharp&mdash;The peoples fall
under thee&mdash;In the heart of the enemies of the king."
The bright arrow is on the string; it whizzes; the
plain is strewed with prostrate forms, the king's shaft
in the heart of each. It is no mere fanciful spiritualising
which sees in this picture an adumbration of the
merciful warfare of Christ all through the ages. We
get to the kernel of the history of Israel when we
regard it as the preparation for Christ. We understand
the <i>raison d'être</i> of its monarchy when we see in these
poor shadows the types of the King of men, who was
to be all that they should have been and were not.
The world-wide conflict for truth and meekness and
righteousness is His conflict, and the help which is
done on earth He doeth it all Himself. The psalm
waits for its completion still, and will wait until the
day when the marriage supper of the Lamb is preceded
by the last battle and crowning victory of Him who
"in righteousness doth judge and make war."</p>

<p>All the older versions take "God," in ver. 6 <i>a</i>, as a
vocative, while most moderns seek another construction
or text. "The sum of the matter is that the only
natural rendering of the received text is that of the
Versions, 'Thy throne, O God'" (Cheyne, <i>in loc.</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Three renderings have been proposed, all of which are
harsh. "Thy throne is the throne of God," etc., is
Ewald's suggestion, revived from a Jewish expositor,
and adopted widely by many recent commentators, and
in the margin of the R.V. It is clumsy, and leaves it
doubtful whether the stress of the assertion lies on the
Divine appointment or on the eternal duration of the
throne. "Thy God's throne is," etc., is very questionable
grammatically, and extremely harsh. The only
other suggested rendering, "Thy throne is God," etc.,
may fairly be pronounced impossible. If the vocative
construction is retained, are we shut up to Cheyne's
further opinion, that "the only natural interpretation
[is] that of the Targum, 'Thy throne, O Jehovah'"?
If so, we shall be obliged to admit textual corruption;
for a reference to the eternal duration of Jehovah's
dominion is quite out of place here, where the parallelism
of the next clause demands some characteristic of
the king's throne corresponding to that of his sceptre,
there stated. But in Exod. xxi. 6, xxii. 8, and Psalm
lxxxii. 6, the name God (Elohim) is applied to rulers
and judges, on the ground, as our Lord puts it, in John
x. 35, that "unto them the word of God came"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
that they were theocratic officers. The designation,
therefore, of the king as Elohim is not contrary to the
Hebrew line of thought. It does not predicate divinity,
but Divine preparation for and appointment to office.
The recurrence of Elohim (God) in its full Divine
signification in the next verse is felt by many to be
an insuperable objection to recognising the lower sense
here. But the emphatic "thy God," which is appended
to the name in ver. 7, seems expressly intended to
distinguish between the uses of the word in the two
verses. August, then, as the title is, it proves nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
as to the divinity of the person addressed. We recognise
the prophetic character of the psalm, and strongly
believe that it points onwards to Christ the King. But
we cannot take the ascription of the title "O God" as
having reference to His Divine nature. Such a thought
lay far beyond the prophetic horizon. The Old
Testament usage, which is appealed to in order to
justify the translation of the word "God" as a vocative,
must govern its meaning. The careful distinction
drawn by the expressions of ver. 7, between the lower
and higher senses of the name, forbid the attempt to
find here a premature and anomalous statement of deep
truth, for which the ages were not ripe. While we,
who know the full truth, may permissibly apply the
psalmist's words as its expression, we must not forget
that in so doing we are going beyond their real
meaning. The controversies waged over the construction
of this verse have sometimes been embittered by
the supposition that it was a buttress for the truth
of Christ's Divine nature. But that is a mistake.
The psalm goes no further than to declare that the
king is divinely endowed and appointed. It does outline
a character fairer than the sons of men, which
requires indwelling Deity for its realisation in humanity.
But it does not speak the decisive word, which alone
could solve the mystery of its requirement, by proclaiming
the fact of incarnation.</p>

<p>The perpetuity of the king's throne is guaranteed,
not only by his theocratic appointment by God, but
by the righteousness of his rule. His sceptre is not
a rod of iron, but "a sceptre of uprightness." He is
righteous in character as well as in official acts. He
"loves righteousness," and therefore cannot but "hate
iniquity." His broad shield shelters all who love and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
seek after righteousness, and he wars against evil
wherever it shows itself. Therefore his throne stands
firm, and is the world's hope. A singer who had
grasped the truth that power divorced from justice
could not endure was far in advance of his time. The
nations have not yet learned his lesson. The vast
robber-kingdoms which seemed to give the lie to his
faith have confirmed it by their evanescence.</p>

<p>The king's love of righteousness leads to his being
"anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows."
This anointing is not that of a coronation, but that of
a feast. His "fellows" may either be other kings
or his attendant companions at his marriage. The
psalmist looks as deep into individual life as he has
just done into politics, and ascribes to righteousness
lofty powers in that region too. The heart which
loves it will be joyful, whatever befalls. Conformity
to the highest ideal known to a man, or, at all events,
hearty love thereof, leading to efforts after it, is the
surest foundation for lasting and deep joy. Since
Christ is the fulfilment of the psalmist's picture, and
perfectly realised the perfection of manhood, the
psalmist's words here are most fully applicable to
Him.</p>

<p>True, He was "a man of sorrows," but beneath His
sorrow had abiding and central joy, which He bequeathed
to us, with the assurance that to possess it
would make our joy full. His pure manhood was ever
in touch with God, and lived in conscious righteousness,
and therefore there was ever light within, though
there was darkness around. He, the saddest, was
likewise the gladdest of men, and "anointed with the
oil of joy above His fellows."</p>

<p>In ver. 8 the Psalm reaches its main theme&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
marriage of the king. The previous verses have
painted his grace of person, his heroic deeds in battle,
and his righteous rule. Now he stands ready to pass
into the palace to meet his bride. His festival robes
are so redolent of perfumes that they seem to be
composed of nothing but woven fragrance. There are
difficulties in the rendering of ver. 8 <i>a</i>, but that adopted
above is generally accepted as the most probable.
The clause then describes the burst of jubilant music
which welcomed and rejoiced the king as he approached
the "palaces of ivory," where his bride waited his
coming.</p>

<p>Ver. 9 carries the king into his harem. The inferior
wives are of royal blood, but nearest him and superior
to these is the queen-consort glittering with golden
ornaments. This feature of the psalmist's description
can only have reference to the actual historical occasion
of the psalm, and warns against overlooking that
in seeking a prophetic reference to the Christ in every
particular.</p>

<p>The second half of the psalm is an address to the
bride and a description of her beauty and state. The
singer assumes a fatherly tone, speaking to her as
"daughter." She is a foreigner by birth, and is called
upon to give up all her former associations, with
whole-hearted consecration to her new duties. It is
difficult to imagine Jezebel or Athaliah as the recipient
of these counsels, nor does it seem to the present
writer to add anything to the enjoyment of the psalm
that the person to whom they were addressed should
be identified. The exhortation to give up all for
love's sake goes to the heart of the sacred relation of
husband and wife, and witnesses to the lofty ideal
of that relation which prevailed in Israel, even though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
polygamy was not forbidden. The sweet necessity
of wedded love subordinates all other love, as a deeper
well, when sunk, draws the surface waters and shallower
springs into itself.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"The rich, golden shaft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath killed the flock of all affections else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That live in her."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The king sung of in the psalm was a type of Christ.
Every true marriage is in the same fashion a type
of the union of the soul with Jesus, the lover of all,
the bridegroom of humanity. So it is not arbitrary
spiritualising, but recognition of the nobleness of the
lower love and of its essential similarity with the
highest, when the counsel to this bride is regarded as
shadowing the duties of the soul wedded to Christ.
If a heart is really influenced by love to Him, that
love will make self-surrender blessed. A child gladly
drops toys when it stretches out its little hand for
better gifts. If we are joined to Jesus, we shall not
be unwilling to "count all things but loss for the
excellency of the knowledge" of Him. Have the
terms of wedded life changed since this psalm was
written? Have the terms of Christian living altered
since it was said, "Whosoever he be of you that
forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple"?
The law still remains, "Daughter, forget
thine own people and Thy father's house." The
exhortation is followed by a promise: "So shall the
king desire thy beauty." The application of these
words to the relations of Christ and His people carries
with it a striking thought that He is affected by the
completeness of our self-surrender and dependence.
He pours love on the unworthy, but that is a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
thing from the love with which He responds to such
abandonment of self and other loves. Holy, noble
living will bring a smile into His face and draw Him
nearer to us.</p>

<p>But whilst there is all this sweet commerce of love
and giving, the bride is reminded that the king is her
lord, and is to be reverenced as well as loved. There
is here, no doubt, the influence of an archaic mode of
regarding marriage and the wife's position. But it still
is true that no woman finds all that her heart needs in
her husband, unless she can bring her reverence where
she has brought her love; and that love will not long
remain if reverence departs. Nor is the warning less
needed in the higher region of the wedlock of the soul
with the Saviour. Some types of emotional religion
have more to say about love than about obedience.
They are full of half-wholesome apostrophes to a "dear
Lord," and are apt to forget the last word in the
emphasis which they put on the first. The beggar-maid
married to a king was full of reverence as well
as love; and the souls whom Jesus stoops to love and
wash and wed are never to forget to blend adoration
with approach and obedience with love.</p>

<p>A picture of the reflected honour and influence of
the bride follows in ver. 12. When she stands by the
king's side, those around recognise her dignity, and
seek to secure her favour. Hupfeld, Hitzig, and others
take "daughter of Tyre" to be a vocative, addressed
to the bride, who is, according to their view, a Tyrian
princess. But there is a strong grammatical objection
to that construction in the copula ("and") prefixed to
"daughter," which is never so prefixed to a vocative
unless preceded by another vocative. Delitzsch, Baethgen,
Perowne, and Cheyne agree in recognising the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
force of that consideration, and the three former regard
the phrase not as a vocative, but as a nominative.
It is a personification of the Tyrians according to a
familiar idiom. The clause is elliptical, and has to
be supplemented by supposing that the same verb,
which appears in the next clause in the plural, is to be
supplied in thought, just as that clause requires the supplement
of "with a gift" from this one. There appears
to be some flaw in the text, as the clauses are unsymmetrical,
and possibly the punctuators have marked
a hiatus by the sign (Pasek) after the word "daughter
of Tyre." To "seek thy favour" is literally to "smooth
thy face"&mdash;a graphic representation. In the highest
region, which we regard the psalm as adumbrating, the
words have fulfilment. The bride standing by her
bridegroom, and showing her love and devotion by
self-abandonment and reverence, will be glorious in the
eyes of those around. They who manifestly live in
loving communion with their Lord will be recognised
for what they are, and, though sometimes hated therefor,
will also be honoured. When the Church has cast
all but Christ out of its heart, it will conquer the world.
"The sons of them that afflicted thee shall come bending
unto thee."</p>

<p>In vv. 13-15 the bride's apparel and nuptial procession
are described. She is "all glorious within,"&mdash;by
which is not meant, as ordinarily supposed, that she
possesses an inner beauty of soul, but that the poet
conceives of her as standing in the inner chamber,
where she has been arrayed in her splendour. Krochmal,
followed by Graetz and Cheyne, changes the text so as
to read <i>corals</i>, or, as Cheyne renders, <i>pearls</i> (Heb.
<i>p'ninim</i>), for <i>within</i> (<i>p'ninah</i>), and thus preserves unity
of subject in the verse by removing the local designation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
But the existing reading is intelligible. In ver. 14
the marriage procession is described. The words
rendered "embroidered robes" are by some taken to
mean "tapestry of divers colours" (Perowne), or richly
woven carpets spread for the bride to walk on, and by
others (Hitzig, Riehm) gay-coloured cushions, to which
she is led in order to sit beside the bridegroom. But
the word means apparel elsewhere, and either of the
other meanings introduces an irrelevant detail of
another kind into the picture. The analogy of other
Scripture metaphors leads at once to interpreting the
bride's attire as symbolic of the purity of character belonging
to the Church. The Apocalypse dresses "the
Lamb's wife" in "fine linen, clean and white." The
psalm arrays her in garments gleaming with gold, which
symbolise splendour and glory, and in embroidered
robes, which suggest the patient use of the slow needle,
and the variegated harmony of colour attained at last.
There is no marriage between Christ and the soul,
unless it is robed in the beauty of righteousness and
manifold graces of character. In other places we read
that the bride "made <i>herself</i> ready," and also that "to
her was <i>granted</i> that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
clean and white," in which sayings are set forth the
double sources of such a garment of the soul. It is
a gift from above. It is "put on" by continual effort,
based on faith. The picture of the home-coming of the
bride follows. She is attended by her maidens, and
with them she passes into the palace amid joys and
exultation. The psalm stops at the threshold. It is
not for the singer to draw back the curtains and let
in the day. "The door was shut." The presence of
virgin companions waiting on the bride no more interferes
with the application of the psalm to Christ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
His Church than the similar representation brings
confusion into our Lord's parable of the Ten Virgins.
Parables and symbols are elastic, and often duplicate
their representations of the same thing; and such is
the case here.</p>

<p>The closing verses are addressed, not to the bride,
but to the king, and can only in a very modified way
and partially be supposed to pass beyond the Jewish
monarch and refer to the true King. Hopes that he
might be blessed with fortunate issue of the marriage
were quite in place in an epithalamion, and the delicacy
of the light touch with which this closing note is struck
is noteworthy, especially in contrast with the tone of
many famous secular songs of similar import. But
much straining is needed to extract a spiritual sense
from the words. Perowne truly says that it is "wiser
to acknowledge at once the mixed character" of the
psalm, and he quotes a sagacious saying of Calvin's
to the effect that it is not necessary that every detail
should be carefully fitted to Christ. The psalm had a
historical basis; and it has also a prophetic meaning,
because the king of Israel was himself a type, and Jesus
Christ is the fulfilment of the ideal never realised by
its successive occupants. Both views of its nature
must be kept in view in its interpretation; and it need
cause no surprise if, at some points, the rind of prose
fact is, so to speak, thicker than at others, or if certain
features absolutely refuse to lend themselves to the
spiritual interpretation.</p>

</p>


<p>There are two events, one or other of which
probably supplies the historical basis of this
and the two following psalms. One is Jehoshaphat's
deliverance from the combined forces of the bordering
nations (2 Chron. xx.). Delitzsch adopts this as the
occasion of the psalm. But the other more usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
accepted reference to the destruction of Sennacherib's
army is more probable. Psalms xlvi. and xlviii. have
remarkable parallelisms with Isaiah. The noble contrast
of the quiet river which makes glad the city of
God with a tossing, earth-shaking sea resembles the
prophet's threatening that the effect of refusing the
"waters of Shiloah which go softly" would be inundation
by the strong and mighty river, the Assyrian
power. And the emblem is expanded in the striking
language of Isa. xxxiii. 21: "The glorious Lord will be
unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein
shall go no galley with oars." Encircled by the flashing
links of that broad moat, Jerusalem sits secure.
Again, the central thought of the refrain in the psalm,
"The Lord of hosts is with us," is closely allied to
the symbolic name which Isaiah gave as a pledge of
deliverance, "Immanuel, God with us."</p>

<p>The structure is simple. The three strophes into
which the psalm falls set forth substantially the same
thought, that God's presence is safety and peace, whatever
storms may roar. This general theme is exhibited
in the first strophe (vv. 1-3) in reference to natural
convulsions; in the second (vv. 4-7) in reference to
the rage of hostile kingdoms; and in the third (vv.
8-11) men are summoned to behold a recent example
of God's delivering might, which establishes the truth
of the preceding utterances and has occasioned the
psalm. The grand refrain which closes the second and
third strophes should probably be restored at the end
of ver. 3.</p>

<p>In the first strophe the psalmist paints chaos come
again, by the familiar figures of a changed earth,
tottering mountains sinking in the raging sea from
which they rose at creation, and a wild ocean with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
thunderous dash appalling the ear and yeasty foam
terrifying the eye, sweeping in triumphant insolence
over all the fair earth. It is prosaic to insist on an
allegorical meaning for the picture. It is rather a
vivid sketch of utter confusion, dashed in with three or
four bold strokes, an impossible case supposed in order
to bring out the unshaken calm of those who have
God for ark in such a deluge. He is not only a sure
refuge and stronghold, but one easy of access when
troubles come. There is little good in a fortress, however
impregnable, if it is so difficult to reach that
a fugitive might be slain a hundred times before he
was safe in it. But this high tower, which no foe can
scale, can be climbed at a thought, and a wish lifts
us within its mighty walls. The psalmist speaks a
deep truth, verified in the spiritual life of all ages, when
he celebrates the refuge of the devout soul as "most
readily to be found."</p>

<p>As the text stands, this strophe is a verse too short,
and ver. 3 drags if connected with "will not we fear."
The restoration of the refrain removes the anomaly in
the length of the strophe, and enables us to detach
ver. 3 from the preceding. Its sense is then completed,
if we regard it as the protasis of a sentence of which
the refrain is the apodosis, or if, with Cheyne and
others, we take ver. 3, "Let its waters roar," etc.&mdash;what
of that? "Jehovah of hosts is with us." If the strophe
is thus completed, it conforms to the other two, in each
of which may be traced a division into two pairs of
verses. These two verse-pairs of the first strophe
would then be inverted parallelism,&mdash;the former putting
security in God first, and surrounding trouble second,
the latter dealing with the same two subjects, but in
reversed sequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The second strophe brings a new picture to view
with impressive suddenness, which is even more vividly
dramatic if the refrain is not supplied. Right against
the vision of confusion comes one of peace. The
abrupt introduction of "a river" as an isolated noun,
which dislocates grammatical structure, is almost an
exclamation. "There is a river" enfeebles the swing
of the original. We might almost translate, "Lo!
a river!" Jerusalem was unique among historical
cities in that it had no great river. It had one tiny
thread of water, of which perhaps the psalmist is
thinking. But whether there is here the same contrast
between Siloam's gentle flow and the surging waters
of hostile powers as Isaiah sets forth in the passage
already referred to (Isa. viii. 6), the meaning of this
gladdening stream is the ever-flowing communication
of God Himself in His grace. The stream is the
fountain in flow. In the former strophe we hear the
roar of the troubled waters, and see the firm hills
toppling into their depths. Now we behold the gentle
flow of the river, gliding through the city, with music
in its ripples and sunshine in its flash and refreshment
in its waters, parting into many arms and yet one
in diversity, and bringing life and gladness wherever
it comes. Not with noise nor tumult, but in silent
communication, God's grace and peace refresh the soul.
Power is loud, but Omnipotence is silent. The roar
of all the billows is weak when compared with the quiet
sliding onwards of that still stream. It has its divisions.
As in old days each man's bit of garden was irrigated
by a branch led from the stream, so in endless diversity,
corresponding to the infinite greatness of the
source and the innumerable variety of men's needs,
God's grace comes. "All these worketh that one and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally."
The streams gladden the city of God with the gladness
of satisfied thirsts, with the gladness which comes from
the contact of the human spirit with Divine completeness.
So supplied, the city may laugh at besiegers.
It has unfailing supplies within itself, and the enemy
may cut off all surface streams, but its "water shall
be sure."</p>

<p>Substantially the same thought is next stated in plain
words: "God is in the midst of her." And therefore
two things follow. One is unshaken stability, and
another is help at the right time&mdash;"at the turn of the
morning." "The Lord is in the midst of her"&mdash;that is
a perennial fact. "The Lord shall help her"&mdash;that is
the "grace for seasonable help." He, not we, determines
when the night shall thin away its blackness
into morning twilight. But we may be sure that the
presence which is the pledge of stability and calm even
in storm and darkness will flash into energy of help
at the moment when He wills. The same expression
is used to mark the time of His looking from the pillar
of cloud and troubling the Egyptians, and there may
be an allusion to that standing instance of His help
here. "It is not for you to know the times and the
seasons"; but this we may know&mdash;that the Lord of all
times will always help at the right time; He will not
come so quickly as to anticipate our consciousness of
need, nor delay so long as to let us be irrevocably
engulfed in the bog. "Jesus loved Martha, and her
sister, and Lazarus. When He heard <i>therefore</i> that
he was sick, He abode two days still in the same place
where He was." Yet He came in time.</p>

<p>With what vigour the short, crashing clauses of ver. 6
describe the wrath and turbulence of the nations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the instantaneous dissolving of their strength into weakness
at a word from those awful lips! The verse may
be taken as hypothetical or as historical. In either
case we see the sequence of events as by a succession
of lightning flashes. The hurry of the style, marked
by the omission of connecting particles, reflects the
swiftness of incident, like <i>Veni, vidi, vici</i>. The utterance
of God's will conquers all. At the sound of that
voice stillness and a pause of dread fall on the "roar"
(same word as in ver. 3) of the nations, like the hush
in the woods when thunder rolls. He speaks, and all
meaner sounds cease. "The lion hath roared, who
shall not fear?" No material vehicle is needed. To
every believer in God there is an incomprehensible
action of the Divine Will on material things; and no
explanations bridge the gulf recognised in the psalmist's
broken utterances, which declare sequence and not mode
of operation: "He uttered His voice, the earth melted."</p>

<p>Again the triumph of the refrain peals forth, with its
musical accompaniment prolonging the impression. In
it the psalmist gives voice, for himself and his fellows,
to their making their own of the general truths which
the psalm has been declaring. The two names of God
set forth a twofold ground for confidence. "Jehovah of
hosts" is all the more emphatic here since the Second
Book of the Psalter is usually Elohistic. It proclaims
God's eternal, self-existent Being, and His covenant
relation, as well as His absolute authority over the
ranked forces of the universe, personal or impersonal,
spiritual or material. The Lord of all these legions
is with us. When we say "The God of Jacob," we
reach back into the past and lay hold of the Helper of
the men of old as ours. What He has been, He is;
what He did, He is doing still. The river is full to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
though the van of the army did long ago drink and
were satisfied. The bright waters are still as pellucid
and abundant as then, and the last of the rear-guard
will find them the same.</p>

<p>The third strophe summons to contemplate with
fixed attention the "desolations" made by some great
manifestation of God's delivering power. It is presupposed
that these are still visible. Broken bows,
splintered spears, half-charred chariots, strew the
ground, and Israel can go forth without fear and feast
their eyes on these tokens of what God has done for
them. The language is naturally applied to the relics
of Sennacherib's annihilated force. In any case it
points to a recent act of God's, the glad surprise of
which palpitates all through the psalm. The field of
history is littered with broken, abandoned weapons,
once flourished in hands long since turned to dust; and
the city and throne of God against which they were
lifted remain unharmed. The voice which melted the
earth speaks at the close of the psalm; not now with
destructive energy, but in warning, through which
tones of tenderness can be caught. God desires that
foes would cease their vain strife before it proves
fatal. "Desist" is here an elliptical expression, of
which the full form is "Let your hands drop"; or, as
we say, "Ground your weapons," and learn how vain
is a contest with Him who is God, and whose fixed
purpose is that all nations shall know and exalt Him.
The prospect hinted at in the last words, of a world
submissive to its King, softens the terrors of His
destructive manifestations, reveals their inmost purpose,
and opens to foes the possibility of passing, not as
conquerors, but as subjects, and therefore fellow-citizens,
through the gate into the city.</p>

</p>


<p>The closing thought of Psalm xlvi. is nobly
expanded in this jubilant summons to all nations
to praise Jehovah as their King. Both psalms have a
similar, and probably the same, historical basis: a Divine
act so recent that the tumult of triumph has not yet
subsided, and the waves of joy still run high. Only
in Psalm xlvi. the effect of that God-wrought deliverance
is principally regarded as the security and peace of
Israel, and in this psalm as the drawing of the nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
to obey Israel's King, and so to join the chorus of
Israel's praise. While the psalm has many resemblances
to the Songs of the King (Psalm xciii. <i>seqq.</i>),
it is clearly in its right place here, as forming with the
preceding and succeeding psalms a trilogy, occasioned
by one great manifestation of God's care for the nation.
No event is more appropriate than the usually accepted
destruction of Sennacherib's army. The psalm has
little of complexity in structure or thought. It is a
gush of pure rapture. It rises to prophetic foresight,
and, by reason of a comparatively small historical
occasion, has a vision of the world-wide expansion of
the kingdom of God. It falls into two strophes of four
verses each, with one longer verse appended to the
latter.</p>

<p>In the first strophe the nations are invited to welcome
God as their King, not only because of His Divine
exaltation and world-wide dominion, but also because
of His deeds for "Jacob." The same Divine act which
in Psalm xlvi. is represented as quelling wars and
melting the earth, and in Psalm xlviii. as bringing
dismay, pain, and flight, is here contemplated as attracting
the nations to worship. The psalmist knows that
destructive providences have their gracious aspect, and
that God's true victory over men is not won when
opposition is crushed and hearts made to quake, but
when recognition of His sway and joy in it swell the
heart. The quick clatter of clapping hands in sign of
homage to the King (2 Kings xi. 12) blends with the
shrill cries with which Easterns express joy, in "a
tumult of acclaim." Hupfeld thinks that to suppose
the heathen called upon to do homage because of the
victory for Israel won over them is entirely mistaken.
But unless that victory is the reason for the summons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the psalm offers none; and it is surely not difficult to
suppose that the exhibition of God's power leads to
reflection which issues in recognition of His sovereignty.
Vv. 3, 4, seem to state the grounds for the summons
in ver. 1. The tenses in these verses present a difficulty
in the way of taking them for a historical retrospect
of the conquest and partition of Canaan, which but
for that objection would be the natural interpretation.
It is possible to take them as "a truth of experience
inferred from what had just been witnessed, the historical
fact being expressed not in historical form, but
generalised and idealised" (Delitzsch, <i>in loc.</i>). The
just accomplished deliverance repeated in essence the
wonders of the first entrance on possession of the land,
and revealed the continuous working of the same Divine
hand, ever renewing the choice of Jacob's inheritance,
and ever scattering its enemies. "The pride of Jacob"
is a phrase in apposition with "our inheritance." The
Holy Land was the object of "pride" to "Jacob," not
in an evil sense but in that he boasted of it as a
precious treasure intrusted to him by God. The root
fact of all God's ancient and continued blessings is that
He "loved." His own heart, not Jacob's deserts,
prompted His mercies.</p>

<p>The second strophe is distinguished from the first by
the increased fervour of its calls to praise, by its still
more exultant rush, and by its omission of reference
to Jacob. It is wholly concerned with the peoples
whom it invites to take up the song. As in the former
strophe the singer showed to the peoples God working
in the world, here he bids them look up and see Him
ascending on high. "Now that He ascended, what is
it but that He also descended first?" The mighty
deliverance of which the triumph throbs through this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
trilogy of pæans of victory was God's coming down.
Now He has gone back to His throne and seated Himself
thereon, not as having ceased to work in the world&mdash;for
He is still King over it all&mdash;but as having completed
a delivering work. He does not withdraw when He goes
up. He does not cease to work here below when He
sits throned in His palace-temple above. The "shout"
and "voice of a trumpet," which accompany that ascent,
are borrowed from the ordinary attendants on a
triumphal procession. He soars as in a chariot of
praises,&mdash;from whose lips the psalm does not say,
but probably it intends Israel to be understood as the
singer. To that choir the nations are called to join
their voices and harps, since God is their King too, and
not Jacob's only. The word rendered in the A.V. and
R.V. (text) "with understanding" is a noun, the name
of a description of psalm, which occurs in several psalm
titles, and is best understood as "a skilful song."
Ver. 8 gathers up the reasons for the peoples' homage
to God. He has "become King" over them by His
recent act, having manifested and established His
dominion; and He has now "sat down on His throne,"
as having accomplished His purpose, and as thence
administering the world's affairs.</p>

<p>A final verse, of double the length of the others,
stands somewhat apart from the preceding strophe
both in rhythm and in thought. It crowns the whole.
The invitations to the nations are conceived of as
having been welcomed and obeyed. And there rises
before the poet's eye a fair picture of a great convocation,
such as might wait before a world-ruling monarch's
throne on the day of his coronation. The princes of the
nations, like tributary kings, come flocking to do homage,
"as if they surely knew their sovereign Lord was by."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>The obliteration of distinction between Israel and
the nations, by the incorporation of the latter, so that
"the peoples" become part of the "people of the
God of Abraham," floats before the singer's prophetic
eye, as the end of God's great manifestation of Himself.
The two parts of that double choir, which the preceding
strophes summon to song, coalesce at last, and in
grand unison send up one full-throated, universal
melodious shout of praise. "The shields of the earth"
are best understood as a figurative expression for the
princes just spoken of, who now at last recognise to
whom they belong. Thus God has exalted Himself by
His deeds; and the result of these deeds is that He is
greatly exalted by the praise of a world, in which Israel
and the "peoples" dwell as one beneath His sceptre
and celebrate His name.</p>

<p>The psalmist looked far ahead. His immediate
experience was as "a little window through which he
saw great matters." The prophecy of the universal
spread of God's kingdom and the inclusion in it of the
Gentiles is Messianic; and whether the singer knew
that he spoke of a fair hope which should not be a fact
for weary centuries, or anticipated wider and permanent
results from that triumph which inspired his song, he
spake of the Christ, and his strains are true prophecies
of His dominion. There is no intentional reference in
the psalm to the Ascension; but the thoughts underlying
its picture of God's going up with a shout are the
same which that Ascension sets forth as facts,&mdash;the
merciful coming down into humanity of the Divine
Helper; the completeness of His victory as attested by
His return thither where He was before; His session
in heaven, not as idle nor wearied, but as having done
what He meant to do; His continuous working as King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in the world; and the widening recognition of His
authority by loving hearts. The psalmist summons us
all to swell with our voices that great chorus of praise
which, like a sea, rolls and breaks in music round His
royal seat.</p>

</p>


<p>The situation seems the same as in Psalm xlvi.,
with which this psalm has many points of contact.
In both we have the same triumph, the same proud
affection for the holy city and sanctuary, the same
confidence in God's dwelling there, the same vivid
picturing of the mustering of enemies and their rapid
dispersion, the same swift movement of style in describing
that overthrow, the same thought of the diffusion
of God's praise in the world as its consequence, the
same closing summons to look upon the tokens of
deliverance, with the difference that, in the former
psalm, these are the shattered weapons of the defeated
foe, and in this the unharmed battlements and palaces
of the delivered city. The emphatic word of the refrain
in Psalm xlvi. also reappears here in ver. 3. The
psalm falls into three parts, of which the first (vv. 1, 2)
is introductory, celebrating the glory of Zion as the
city of God; the second (vv. 3-8) recounts in glowing
words the deliverance of Zion; and the third tells of
the consequent praise and trust of the inhabitants of
Zion (vv. 9-14).</p>

<p>The general sense of the first part is plain, but ver. 2
is difficult. "Mount Zion" is obviously subject, and
"lovely in loftiness" and "joy of all the earth" predicates;
but the grammatical connection of the two last
clauses is obscure. Further, the meaning of "the
sides of the north" has not been satisfactorily ascertained.
The supposition that there is an allusion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the phrase to the mythological mountain of the gods,
with which Zion is compared, is surely most unnatural.
Would a Hebrew psalmist be likely to introduce such
a parallel, even in order to assert the superiority of
Zion? Nor is the grammatical objection to the supposition
less serious. It requires a good deal of stretching
and inserting to twist the two words "the sides of the
north" into a comparison. It is more probable that
the clause is topographical, describing some part of
the city, but what part is far from clear. The accents
make all the verse after "earth" the subject of the two
preceding predicates, and place a minor division at
"north," implying that "the sides of the north" is
more closely connected with "Mount Zion" than with
the "city of the great King," or than that last clause is.</p>

<p>Following these indications, Stier renders "Mount
Zion [and] the northern side (<i>i.e.</i>, the lower city, on
the north of Zion), which together make the city," etc.
Others see here "the Holy City regarded from three
points of view"&mdash;viz., "the Mount Zion" (the city of
David), "the sides of the north" (Mount Moriah and
the Temple), "the city of the great King" (Jerusalem
proper). So Perowne and others. Delitzsch takes
Zion to be the Temple hill, and "the sides of the north"
to be in apposition. "The Temple hill or Zion, in the
narrower sense, actually formed the north-eastern corner
of ancient Jerusalem," says he, and thus regards the
subject of the whole sentence as really twofold, not
threefold, as appears at first&mdash;Zion on the north, which
is the palace-temple, and Jerusalem at its feet, which
is "the city of the great King." But it must be admitted
that no interpretation runs quite smoothly, though the
summary ejection of the troublesome words "the sides
of the north" from the text is too violent a remedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>But the main thought of this first part is independent
of such minute difficulties. It is that the one thing
which made Zion-Jerusalem glorious was God's presence
in it. It was beautiful in its elevation; it was
safely isolated from invaders by precipitous ravines,
inclosing the angle of the plateau on which it stood.
But it was because God dwelt there and manifested
Himself there that it was "a joy for all the earth."
The name by which even the earthly Zion is called
is "Jehovah-Shammah, The Lord is there." We are
not forcing New Testament ideas into Old Testament
words when we see in the psalm an eternal truth.
An idea is one thing; the fact which more or less
perfectly embodies it is another. The idea of God's
dwelling with men had its less perfect embodiment in
the presence of the Shechinah in the Temple, its more
perfect in the dwelling of God in the Church, and will
have its complete when the city "having the glory of
God" shall appear, and He will dwell with men and
be their God. God in her, not anything of her own,
makes Zion lovely and gladdening. "Thy beauty was
perfect through My comeliness which I had put upon
thee, saith the Lord."</p>

<p>The second part pictures Zion's deliverance with
picturesque vigour (vv. 3-8). Ver. 3 sums up the
whole as the act of God, by which He has made Himself
known as that which the refrain of Psalm xlvi.
declared Him to be&mdash;a refuge, or, literally, a high
tower. Then follows the muster of the hosts. "The
kings were assembled." That phrase need not be
called exaggeration, nor throw doubt on the reference
to Sennacherib's army, if we remember the policy of
Eastern conquerors in raising their armies from their
conquests, and the boast which Isaiah puts into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
mouth of the Assyrian: "Are not my princes altogether
kings?" They advance against the city. "They saw,"&mdash;no
need to say what. Immediately they "were
amazed." The sight of the city broke on them from
some hill-crest on their march. Basilisk-like, its
beauty was paralysing, and shot a nameless awe into
their hearts. "They were terror-struck; they fled." As
in Psalm xlvi. 6, the clauses, piled up without cement
of connecting particles, convey an impression of hurry,
culminating in the rush of panic-struck fugitives. As
has been often noticed, they recall Cæsar's <i>Veni, vidi,
vici</i>; but these kings came, saw, <i>were</i> conquered. No
cause for the rout is named. No weapons were drawn
in the city. An unseen hand "smites once, and smites
no more"; for once is enough. The process of deliverance
is not told; for a hymn of victory is not a
chronicle. One image explains it all, and signalises the
Divine breath as the sole agent. "Thou breakest the
ships of Tarshish with an east wind" is not history,
but metaphor. The unwieldy, huge vessel, however
strong for fight, is unfit for storms, and, caught in a
gale, rolls heavily in the trough of the sea, and is
driven on a lee shore and ground to pieces on its
rocks. "God blew upon them, and they were scattered,"
as the medal struck on the defeat of the Armada had
it. In the companion psalm God's uttered voice did
all. Here the breath of the tempest, which is the
breath of His lips, is the sole agent.</p>

<p>The past, of which the nation had heard from its
fathers, lives again in their own history; and that
verification of traditional belief by experience is to
a devout soul the chief blessing of its deliverances.
There is rapture in the thought that "As we have
heard, so have we seen." The present ever seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
commonplace. The sky is farthest from earth right
overhead, but touches the ground on the horizon behind
and before. Miracles were in the past; God will be
manifestly in the far-off future, but the present is apt
to seem empty of Him. But if we rightly mark His
dealings with us, we shall learn that nothing in His
past has so passed that it is not present. As the
companion psalm says, "The God of Jacob is <i>our</i>
refuge," this exclaims, "As we have heard, so have we
seen."</p>

<p>But not only does the deliverance link the present
with the past, but it flings a steady light into the
future. "God shall establish her for ever." The city
is truly "the eternal city," because God dwells in it.
The psalmist was thinking of the duration of the actual
Jerusalem, the imperfect embodiment of a great idea.
But whatever may be its fate, the heart of his confidence
is no false vision; for God's city will outlast the
world. Like the "maiden fortresses," of which there
is one in almost every land, fondly believed never to
have been taken by enemies, that city is inexpugnable,
and the confident answer to every threatening assailant
is, "The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised
thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of
Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee." "God will
establish her for ever." The pledges of that stability
are the deliverances of the past and present.</p>

<p>The third part (vv. 9-14) deals with the praise and
trust of the inhabitants of Zion. Deliverance leads to
thankful meditation on the loving-kindness which it so
signally displayed, and the ransomed people first gather
in the Temple, which was the scene of God's manifestation
of His grace, and therefore is the fitting place for
them to ponder it. The world-wide consequences of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
great act of loving-kindness almost shut out of sight
for the moment its bearing on the worshippers. It is a
lofty height to which the song climbs, when it regards
national deliverance chiefly as an occasion for wider
diffusion of God's praise. His "name" is the manifestation
of His character in act. The psalmist is sure
that wherever that character is declared praise will
follow, because he is sure that that character is perfectly
and purely good, and that God cannot act but in such
a way as to magnify Himself. That great sea will cast
up nothing but pearls. The words carry also a lesson
for recipients of Divine loving-kindness, teaching them
that they misapprehend the purpose of their blessings,
if they confine these to their own well-being and lose
sight of the higher object&mdash;that men may learn to know
and love Him. But the deliverance not only produces
grateful meditation and widespread praise; it sets the
mother city and her daughter villages astir, like Miriam
and her maidens, with timbrel and dance, and ringing
songs which celebrate "Thy judgments," terrible as
they were. That dead host was an awful sight, and
hymns of praise seem heartless for its dirge. But it
is not savage glee nor fierce hatred which underlies
the psalmist's summons, and still less is it selfish joy.
"Thy judgments" are to be hymned when they smite
some giant evil; and when systems and their upholders
that array themselves against God are drowned in some
Red Sea, it is fitting that on its banks should echo,
"Sing ye to Jehovah, for He hath triumphed gloriously."</p>

<p>The close of this part may be slightly separated from
vv. 9-11. The citizens who have been cooped up by
the siege are bidden to come forth, and, free from
fear, to compass the city without, and pass between its
palaces within, and so see how untouched they are.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
The towers and bulwark or rampart remain unharmed,
with not a stone smitten from its place. Within, the
palaces stand without a trace of damage to their beauty.
Whatever perishes in any assaults, that which is of God
will abide; and, after all musterings of the enemy,
the uncaptured walls will rise in undiminished strength,
and the fair palaces which they guard glitter in untarnished
splendour. And this complete exemption
from harm is to be told to the generation following,
that they may learn what a God this God is, and how
safely and well He will guide all generations.</p>

<p>The last word in the Hebrew text, which the A.V. and
R.V. render "even unto death," can scarcely have that
meaning. Many attempts have been made to find a
signification appropriate to the close of such a triumphal
hymn as this, but the simplest and most probable course
is to regard the words as a musical note, which is either
attached abnormally to the close of the psalm, or has
strayed hither from the superscription of Psalm xlix.
It is found in the superscription of Psalm ix.
("Al-Muth") as a musical direction, and has in all
likelihood the same meaning here. If it is removed,
the psalm ends abruptly, but a slight transposition of
words and change of the main division of the verse
remove that difficulty by bringing "for ever and aye"
from the first half. The change improves both halves,
laying the stress of the first exclusively on the thought
that this God is such a God (or, by another rendering,
"is here," <i>i.e.</i>, in the city), without bringing in reference
to the eternity of His protection, and completing the
second half worthily, with the thought of His eternal
guidance of the people among whom He dwells.</p>

<p>This psalm touches the high-water mark of Old
Testament faith in a future life; and in that
respect, as well as in its application of that faith to
alleviate the mystery of present inequalities and non-correspondence
of desert with condition, is closely
related to the noble Psalm lxxiii., with which it has
also several verbal identities. Both have the same
problem before them&mdash;to construct a theodicy, or "to
vindicate the ways of God to man"&mdash;and both solve
it in the same fashion. Both appear to refer to the
story of Enoch in their remarkable expression for
ultimate reception into the Divine presence. But
whether the psalms are contemporaneous cannot be
determined from these data. Cheyne regards the
treatment of the theme in Psalm lxxiii. as "more skilful,"
and therefore presumably later than Psalm xlix.,
which he would place "somewhat before the close of
the Persian period." This date rests on the assumption
that the amount of certitude as to a future life
expressed in the psalm was not realised in Israel till
after the exile.</p>

<p>After a solemn summons to all the world to hear
the psalmist's utterance of what he has learned by
Divine teaching (vv. 1-4), the psalm is divided into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
two parts, each closed with a refrain. The former
of these (vv. 5-12) contrasts the arrogant security
of the prosperous godless with the end that awaits
them; while the second (vv. 13-20) contrasts the
dreary lot of these victims of vain self-confidence
with the blessed reception after death into God's own
presence which the psalmist grasped as a certainty
for himself, and thereon bases an exhortation to
possess souls in patience while the godless prosper,
and to be sure that their lofty structures will topple
into hideous ruin.</p>

<p>The psalmist's consciousness that he speaks by
Divine inspiration, and that his message imports all
men, is grandly expressed in his introductory summons.
The very name which he gives to the world
suggests the latter thought; for it means&mdash;the world
considered as fleeting. Since we dwell in so transitory
an abode, it becomes us to listen to the deep
truths of the psalm. These have a message for high
and low, for rich and poor. They are like a keen
lancet to let out too great fulness of blood from the
former, and to teach moderation, lowliness, and care
for the Unseen. They are a calming draught for the
latter, soothing when perplexed or harmed by "the
proud man's contumely." But the psalmist calls for
universal attention, not only because his lessons fit all
classes, but because they are in themselves "wisdom,"
and because he himself had first bent his ear to receive
them before he strung his lyre to utter them. The
brother-psalmist, in Psalm lxxiii., presents himself as
struggling with doubt and painfully groping his way to
his conclusion. This psalmist presents himself as a
divinely inspired teacher, who has received into purged
and attentive ears; in many a whisper from God, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
as the result of many an hour of silent waiting, the
word which he would now proclaim on the housetops.
The discipline of the teacher of religious truth is the
same at all times. There must be the bent ear before
there is the message which men will recognise as
important and true.</p>

<p>There is no parable in the ordinary sense in the
psalm. The word seems to have acquired the wider
meaning of a weighty didactic utterance, as in Psalm
lxxviii. 2. The expression "Open my riddle" is
ambiguous, and is by some understood to mean the
proposal and by others the solution of the puzzle; but
the phrase is more naturally understood of solving than
of setting a riddle, and if so, the disproportion between
the characters and fortunes of good and bad is the
mystery or riddle, and the psalm is its solution.</p>

<p>The main theme of the first part is the certainty of
death, which makes infinitely ludicrous the rich man's
arrogance. It is one version of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is no armour against Fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Death lays his icy hand on kings."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Therefore how vain the boasting in wealth, when all its
heaps cannot buy a day of life! This familiar thought
is not all the psalmist's contribution to the solution of
the mystery of life's unequal partition of worldly good;
but it prepares the way for it, and it lays a foundation
for his refusal to be afraid, however pressed by insolent
enemies. Very significantly he sets the conclusion, to
which observation of the transiency of human prosperity
has led him, at the beginning of his "parable."
In the parallel psalm (lxxiii.) the singer shows himself
struggling from the depths of perplexity up to the
sunny heights of faith. But here the poet begins with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the clear utterance of trustful courage, and then vindicates
it by the thought of the impotence of wealth to
avert death.</p>

<p>The hostility to himself of the self-confident rich
boasters appears only for a moment at first. It is
described by a gnarled, energetic phrase which has
been diversely understood. But it seems clear that
the "iniquity" (A.V. and R.V.) spoken of in ver. 5 <i>b</i>
is not the psalmist's sin, for a reference here to his
guilt or to retribution would be quite irrelevant; and
if it were the consequences of his own evil that dogged
him at his heels, he had every reason to fear, and confidence
would be insolent defiance. But the word
rendered in the A.V. <i>heels</i>, which is retained in the
R.V. with a change in construction, may be a participial
noun, derived from a verb meaning to trip up
or supplant; and this gives a natural coherence to the
whole verse, and connects it with the following one.
"Pursuers" is a weak equivalent for the literal "those
who would supplant me," but conveys the meaning,
though in a somewhat enfeebled condition. Ver. 6 is
a continuance of the description of the supplanters.
They are "men of this world," the same type of man
as excites stern disapproval in many psalms: as, for
instance, in xvii. 14&mdash;a psalm which is closely related
to this, both in its portrait of the godless and its lofty
hope for the future. It is to be noted that they are
not described as vicious or God-denying or defying.
They are simply absorbed in the material, and believe
that land and money are the real, solid goods. They
are the same men as Jesus meant when He said that
it was hard for those who trusted in riches to enter into
the kingdom of heaven. It has been thought that the
existence of such a class points to a late date for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
psalm; but the reliance on riches does not require large
riches to rely on, and may flourish in full perniciousness
in very primitive social conditions. A small elevation
suffices to lift a man high enough above his fellows to
make a weak head giddy. Those to whom material
possessions are the only good have a natural enmity
towards those who find their wealth in truth and goodness.
The poet, the thinker, and, most of all, the
religious man, are targets for more or less active
"malice," or, at all events, are recognised as belonging
to another class, and regarded as singular and "unpractical,"
if nothing worse. But the psalmist looks far
enough ahead to see the end of all the boasting, and
points to the great instance of the impotence of material
good&mdash;its powerlessness to prolong life. It would
be more natural to find in ver. 7 the statement that
the rich man cannot prolong his own days than that
he cannot do so for a "brother." A very slight change
in the text would make the initial word of the verse
("brother") the particle of asseveration, which occurs in
ver. 15 (the direct antithesis of this verse), and is characteristic
of the parallel Psalm lxxiii. With that reading
(Ewald, Cheyne, Baethgen, etc.) other slight difficulties
are smoothed; but the present text is attested by the
LXX. and other early versions, and is capable of defence.
It may be necessary to observe that there is no reference
here to any other "redemption" than that of the
body from physical death. There is a distinct intention
to contrast the man's limited power with God's, for
ver. 15 points back to this verse, and declares that
God can do what man cannot. Ver. 8 must be taken
as a parenthesis, and the construction carried on from
ver. 7 to ver. 9, which specifies the purpose of the
ransom, if it were possible. No man can secure for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
another continuous life or an escape from the necessity
of seeing the pit&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, going down to the depths of
death. It would cost more than all the rich man's
store; wherefore he&mdash;the would-be ransomer&mdash;must
abandon the attempt for ever.</p>

<p>The "see" in ver. 10 is taken by many to have the
same object as the "see" in ver. 9. "Yea, he shall
see it." (So Hupfeld, Hitzig, Perowne, and others.)
"The wise die" will then begin a new sentence. But
the repetition is feeble, and breaks up the structure
of ver. 10 undesirably. The fact stares the rich man
in the face that no difference of position or of character
affects the necessity of death. Down into that insatiable
maw of Sheol ("the ever-asking"?) beauty, wisdom,
wealth, folly, and animalism go alike, and it still gapes
wide for fresh food. But a strange hallucination in the
teeth of all experience is cherished in the "inward
thought" of "the men of this world"&mdash;namely, that their
houses shall continue for ever. Like the godless man
in Psalm x., this rich man has reached a height of
false security, which cannot be put into words without
exposing its absurdity, but which yet haunts his inmost
thoughts. The fond imagination of perpetuity is not
driven out by the plain facts of life and death. He
acts on the presumption of permanence; and he whose
working hypothesis is that he is to abide always as his
permanent home in his sumptuous palace, is rightly set
down as believing in the incredible belief that the
common lot will not be his. A man's real belief is that
which moulds his life, though he has never formulated
it in words. This "inward thought" either underlies
the rich godless man's career, or that career is inexplicable.
There is an emphatic contrast drawn between
what he "sees" and what he, all the while, hugs in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
secret heart. That contrast is lost if the emendation
found in the LXX. and adopted by many modern commentators
is accepted, according to which, by the transposition
of a letter, we get "their grave" instead of "their
inward [thought]." A reference to the grave comes too
early; and if the sense of ver. 11 <i>a</i> is that "their grave
(or, the graves) are their houses for ever," there is no
parallelism between ver. 11 <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>. The delusion of
continuance is, on the other hand, naturally connected
with the proud attempt to make their names immortal
by impressing them on their estates. The language of
ver. 11 <i>c</i> is somewhat ambiguous; but, on the whole, the
rendering "they call their lands by their own names"
accords best with the context.</p>

<p>Then comes with a crash the stern refrain which
pulverises all this insanity of arrogance. The highest
distinction among men gives no exemption from the
grim law which holds all corporeal life in its gripe.
The psalmist does not look, and probably did not see,
beyond the external fact of death. He knows nothing
of a future for the men whose portion is in this life.
As we shall see in the second part of the psalm, the
confidence in immortality is for him a deduction from
the fact of communion with God here, and, apparently,
his bent ear had received no whisper as to any distinction
between the godless man and the beast in the
regard to their deaths. They are alike "brought to
silence." The awful dumbness of the dead strikes
on his heart and imagination as most pathetic. "That
skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once," and now
the pale lips are locked in eternal silence, and some
ears hunger in vain "for the sound of a voice that is
still."</p>

<p>Hupfeld would transfer ver. 13, which begins the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
second part, so that it should stand before the refrain,
which would then have the Selah, that now comes in
peculiarly at the end of ver. 13. But there is nothing
unnatural in the first verse of the second part summing
up the contents of the first part; and such a summary
is needed in order to bring out the contrast between
the godless folly and end of the rich men on the one
hand, and the hope of the psalmist on the other. The
construction of ver. 13 is disputed. The "way" may
either mean conduct or fate, and the word rendered in the
A.V. and R.V. "folly" has also the meaning of stupid
security or self-confidence. It seems best to regard the
sentence as not pronouncing again that the conduct
described in vv. 6-11 is foolish, but that the end foretold
in ver. 12 surely falls on such as have that dogged
insensibility to the facts of life which issues in such
presumptuous assurance. Many commentators would
carry on the sentence into ver. 13 <i>b</i>, and extend the "lot"
to those who in after-generations approve their sayings.
But the paradoxical fact that notwithstanding each
generation's experience the delusion is obstinately maintained
from father to son yields a fuller meaning. In
either case the notes of the musical interlude fix attention
on the thought, in order to make the force of the
following contrast greater. That contrast first deals
with the fate of godless men after death. The comparison
with the "beasts" in the refrain may have
suggested the sombre grandeur of the metaphor in ver.
14 <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>: Sheol is as a great fold into which flocks
are driven. There Death rules as the shepherd of that
dim realm. What a contrast to the fold and the flock
of the other Shepherd, who guides His unterrified sheep
through the "valley of the shadow of death"! The
waters of stillness beside which this sad shepherd makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
his flock lie down are doleful and sluggish. There is
no cheerful activity for these, nor any fair pastures, but
they are penned in compelled inaction in that dreadful
fold.</p>

<p>So far the picture is comparatively clear, but with
the next clause difficulties begin. Does the "morning"
mean only the end of the night of trouble, the
beginning in this life of the "upright's" deliverance, or
have we here an eschatological utterance? The whole
of the rest of the verse has to do with the unseen world,
and to confine this clause to the temporal triumph of
the righteous over their dead oppressors drags in an
idea belonging to another sphere altogether. We
venture to regard the interpretation of these enigmatical
words, which sees in them a dim adumbration of a great
morning which will yet stream its light into the land of
darkness, and in which not this or that upright man
but the class as a whole shall triumph, as the only one
which keeps the parts of the verse in unity. It is part
of the "riddle" of the psalmist, probably not perfectly
explicable to himself. We cannot say that there is here
the clear teaching of a resurrection, but there is the
germ of it, whether distinctly apprehended by the
singer or not. The first glimpses of truth in all regions
are vague, and the gazer does not know that the star
he sees is a sun. Not otherwise did the great truths
of the future life rise on inspired men of old. This
psalmist divined, or, more truly, heard in his bent ear,
that Good and its lovers should triumph beyond the
grave, and that somehow a morning would break for
them. But he knew nothing of any such for the godless
dead. And the remainder of the verse expresses
in enigmatical brevity and obscurity the gloomy fate
of those for whom there was no such awakening as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
he hoped for himself. Very different renderings have
been given of the gnarled words. If we adhere to
the accents, the literal translation is, "Their form is
[destined] for the wasting of Sheol, from a dwelling-place
for it," or "without its dwelling-place"&mdash;an obscure
saying, which is, however, intelligible when rendered as
above. It describes the wasting away of the whole
man, not merely his corporeal form, in Sheol, of which
the corruption of the body in the grave may stand as a
terrible symbol, so that only a thin shred of personality
remains, which wanders homeless, unclothed with any
house either "of this tabernacle" or any other, and so
found drearily naked. Homeless desolation of bare
being, from which all that is fair or good has been
gnawed away, is awfully expressed in the words.
Other renderings, neglecting the accents and amending
the text, bring out other meanings: such as "Their
form is for corruption; Hades [will be] its dwelling-place"
(Jennings and Lowe); "Their form shall waste
away. Sheol shall be their castle for ever" (so Cheyne
in "Book of Psalms"; in "Orig. of Psalt." <i>frame</i> is substituted
for <i>form</i>, and <i>palace</i> for <i>castle</i>. Baethgen gives
up the attempt to render the text or to restore it, and
takes to asterisks).</p>

<p>To this condition of dismal inactivity, as of sheep
penned in a fold, of loss of beauty, of wasting and homelessness,
the psalmist opposes the fate which he has risen
to anticipate for himself. Ver. 15 is plainly antithetical,
not only to ver. 14, but to ver. 7. The "redemption"
which was impossible with men is possible with God.
The emphatic particle of asseveration and restriction
at the beginning is, as we have remarked, characteristic
of the parallel Psalm lxiii. It here strengthens
the expression of confidence, and points to God as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
alone able to deliver His servant from the "hand of
Sheol." That deliverance is clearly not escape from
the universal lot, which the psalmist has just proclaimed
so impressively as affecting wise and foolish alike.
But while he expects that he, too, will have to submit
to the strong hand that plucks all men from their
dwelling-places, he has won the assurance that sameness
of outward lot covers absolute difference in the
conditions of those who are subjected to it. The faith
that he will be delivered from the power of Sheol does
not necessarily imply the specific kind of deliverance
involved in resurrection, and it may be a question
whether that idea was definitely before the singer's
mind. But, without dogmatising on that doubtful
point, plainly his expectation was of a life beyond death,
the antithesis of the cheerless one just painted in such
gloomy colours. The very brevity of the second clause
of the verse makes it the more emphatic.</p>

<p>The same pregnant phrase occurs again with the
same emphasis in Psalm lxxiii. 24, "Thou shalt take
me," and in both passages the psalmist is obviously
quoting from the narrative of Enoch's translation.
"God took him" (Gen. v. 24). He has fed his faith on
that signal instance of the end of a life of communion
with God, and it has confirmed the hopes which such
a life cannot but kindle, so that he is ready to submit
to the common lot, bearing in his heart the assurance
that, in experiencing it, he will not be driven by that
grim shepherd into his gloomy fold, but lifted by God
into His own presence. As in Psalms xvi. and xvii.,
we have here the certainty of immortality filling a
devout soul as the result of present experience of
communion with God. These great utterances as to
the two contrasted conditions after death are, in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
aspect, the psalmist's "riddle," in so far as they are
stated in "dark and cloudy words," but, in another
view, are the solution of the painful enigma of the
prosperity of the godless and the afflictions of the
righteous. Fittingly the Selah follows this solemn,
great hope.</p>

<p>As the first part began with the psalmist's encouraging
of himself to put away fear, so the whole ends with
the practical application of the truths declared, in the
exhortation to others not to be terrified nor bewildered
out of their faith by the insolent inflated prosperity of
the godless. The lofty height of wholesome mysticism
reached in the anticipation of personal immortality is
not maintained in this closing part. The ground of
the exhortation is simply the truth proclaimed in the
first part, with additional emphasis on the thought of
the necessary parting from all wealth and pomp.
"Shrouds have no pockets." All the external is left
behind, and much of the inward too&mdash;such as habits,
desires, ways of thinking, and acquirements which have
been directed to and bounded by the seen and temporal.
What is not left behind is character and desert. The
man of this world is wrenched from his possessions
by death; but he who has made God his portion here
carries his portion with him, and does not enter on that
other state</p>

</div></div>

<p>Our Lord's parable of the foolish rich man has
echoes of this psalm. "Whose shall those things be?"
reminds us of "He will not take away any of it"; and
"Soul, thou hast much goods laid up ... take thine
ease" is the best explanation of what the psalmist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
meant by "blessing his soul." The godless rich man
of the psalm is a selfish and godless one. His condemnation
lies not in his wealth, but in his absorption in it
and reliance upon it, and in his cherishing the dream
of perpetual enjoyment of it, or at least shunning
the thought of its loss. Therefore, "when he dies, he
goes to the generation of his fathers," who are conceived
of as gathered in solemn assembly in that dark
realm. "Generation" here implies, as it often does,
moral similarity. It includes all the man's predecessors
of like temper with himself. A sad company sitting
there in the dark! <i>Going to them</i> is not identical with
death nor with burial, but implies at least some rudimentary
notion of companionship according to character,
in that land of darkness. The <i>darkness</i> is the privation
of all which deserves the name of light, whether it be
joy or purity. Ver. 18 <i>b</i> is by some taken to be the
psalmist's address to the rich man, and by others to be
spoken to the disciple who had been bidden not to fear.
In either case it brings in the thought of the popular
applause which flatters success, and plays chorus to
the prosperous man's own self-congratulations. Like
ver. 13 <i>b</i>, it gibbets the servile admiration of such men,
as indicating what the praisers would fain themselves
be, and as a disclosure of that base readiness to worship
the rising sun, which has for its other side contempt
for the unfortunate who should receive pity and help.</p>

<p>The refrain is slightly but significantly varied. Instead
of "abides not," it reads "and has not understanding."
The alteration in the Hebrew is very
slight, the two verbs differing only by one letter, and
the similarity in sound is no doubt the reason for the
selection of the word. But the change brings out the
limitations under which the first form of the refrain is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
true, and guards the whole teaching of the psalm from
being taken to be launched at rich men as such. The
illuminative addition in this second form shows that it
is the abuse of riches, when they steal away that
recognition of God and of man's mortality which
underlies the psalmist's conception of <i>understanding</i>,
that is doomed to destruction like the beasts that are
put to silence. The two forms of the refrain are, then,
precisely parallel to our Lord's two sayings, when He
first declared that it was hard for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of heaven, and then, in answer to His
disciples' surprise, put His dictum in the more definite
form, "How hard is it for them that trust in riches to
enter into the kingdom!"</p>

<p>This is the first of the Asaph psalms, and is separated
from the other eleven (Psalms lxxiii.-lxxxiii.)
for reasons that do not appear. Probably they are no
more recondite than the verbal resemblance between the
summons to all the earth at the beginning of Psalm xlix.
and the similar proclamation in the first verses of
Psalm l. The arrangement of the Psalter is often
obviously determined by such slight links. The group
has certain features in common, of which some appear
here: <i>e.g.</i>, the fondness for descriptions of theophanies;
the prominence given to God's judicial action; the preference
for the Divine names of El, Adonai (the Lord),
Ely&#333;n (Most High). Other peculiarities of the class&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
the love for the designation "Joseph" for the nation,
and delight in the image of the Divine Shepherd&mdash;are
not found in this psalm. It contains no historical
allusions which aid in dating it. The leading idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
it&mdash;viz., the depreciation of outward sacrifice&mdash;is unhesitatingly
declared by many to have been impossible in
the days of the Levite Asaph, who was one of David's
musical staff. But is it so certain that such thoughts
were foreign to the period in which Samuel declared
that obedience was better than sacrifice? Certainly
the tone of the psalm is that of later prophets, and
there is much probability in the view that Asaph is the
name of the family or guild of singers from whom these
psalms came rather than that of an individual.</p>

<p>The structure is clear and simple. There is, first, a
magnificent description of God's coming to judgment
and summoning heaven and earth to witness while
He judges His people (vv. 1-6). The second part
(vv. 7-15) proclaims the worthlessness of sacrifice;
and the third (vv. 16-21) brands hypocrites who pollute
God's statutes by taking them into their lips while their
lives are foul. A closing strophe of two verses (22, 23)
gathers up the double lesson of the whole.</p>

<p>The first part falls again into two, of three verses
each, of which the former describes the coming of the
judge, and the latter the opening of the judgment.
The psalm begins with a majestic heaping together of
the Divine names, as if a herald were proclaiming the
style and titles of a mighty king at the opening of a
solemn assize. No English equivalents are available,
and it is best to retain the Hebrew, only noting that
each name is separated from the others by the accents
in the original, and that to render either "the mighty
God" (A.V.) or "the God of gods" is not only against
that punctuation, but destroys the completeness symbolised
by the threefold designation. Hupfeld finds
the heaping together of names "frosty." Some ears
will rather hear in it a solemn reiteration like the boom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of triple thunders. Each name has its own force of
meaning. El speaks of God as mighty; Elohim, as
the object of religious fear; Jehovah, as the self-existent
and covenant God.</p>

<p>The earth from east to west is summoned, not to be
judged, but to witness God judging His people. The
peculiarity of this theophany is that God is not represented
as coming from afar or from above, but as letting
His light blaze out from Zion, where He sits enthroned.
As His presence made the city "the joy of the whole
earth" (Psalm xlviii. 2), so it makes Zion the sum of
all beauty. The idea underlying the representation of
His shining out of Zion is that His presence among
His people makes certain His judgment of their worship.
It is the poetic clothing of the prophetic announcement,
"You only have I known of all the inhabitants of the
earth; therefore will I punish you for your iniquities."
The seer beholds the dread pomp of the advent of
the Judge, and describes it with accessories familiar
in such pictures: devouring fire is His forerunner, as
clearing a path for Him among tangles of evil, and wild
tempests whirl round His stable throne. "He cannot
be silent." The form of the negation in the original
is emotional or emphatic, conveying the idea of the
impossibility of His silence in the face of such
corruptions.</p>

<p>The opening of the court or preparation for the judgment
follows. That Divine voice speaks, summoning
heaven and earth to attend as spectators of the solemn
process. The universal significance of God's relation
to and dealings with Israel, and the vindication of His
righteousness by His inflexible justice dealt out to their
faults, are grandly taught in this making heaven and
earth assessors of that tribunal. The court having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
been thus constituted, the Judge on His seat, the
spectators standing around, the accused are next brought
in. There is no need to be prosaically definite as to
the attendants who are bidden to escort them. His
officers are everywhere, and to ask who they are in the
present case is to apply to poetry the measuring lines
meant for bald prose. It is more important to note the
names by which the persons to be judged are designated.
They are "My favoured ones, who have made
a covenant with Me by (lit. <i>over</i>) sacrifice." These
terms carry an indictment, recalling the lavish mercies
so unworthily requited, and the solemn obligations so
unthankfully broken. The application of the name
"favoured ones" to the whole nation is noteworthy.
In other psalms it is usually applied to the more devout
section, who are by it sharply distinguished from the
mass; here it includes the whole. It does not follow
that the diversity of usage indicates difference of date.
All that is certainly shown is difference of point of view.
Here the ideal of the nation is set forth, in order to
bring out more emphatically the miserable contrast of
the reality. Sacrifice is set aside as worthless in the
subsequent verses. But could the psalmist have given
clearer indication that his depreciation is not to be exaggerated
into entire rejection of external rites, than by thus
putting in front of it the worth of sacrifice when offered
aright, as the means of founding and sustaining covenant
relations with God? If his own words had been given
heed to, his commentators would have been saved the
blunder of supposing that he is antagonistic to the
sacrificial worship which he thus regards.</p>

<p>But before the assize opens, the heavens, which had
been summoned to behold, declare beforehand His
righteousness, as manifested by the fact that He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
about to judge His people. The Selah indicates that
a long-drawn swell of music fills the expectant pause
before the Judge speaks from His tribunal.</p>

<p>The second part (vv. 7-15) deals with one of the two
permanent tendencies which work for the corruption of
religion&mdash;namely, the reliance on external worship, and
neglect of the emotions of thankfulness and trust. God
appeals first to the relation into which He has entered
with the people, as giving Him the right to judge.
There may be a reference to the Mosaic formula, "I am
Jehovah, thy God," which is here converted, in accordance
with the usage of this book of the Psalter, into
"God (Elohim), thy God." The formula which was the
seal of laws when enacted is also the warrant for the
action of the Judge. He has no fault to find with
the external acts of worship. They are abundant
and "continually before Him." Surely this declaration
at the outset sets aside the notion that the psalmist
was launching a polemic against sacrifices <i>per se</i>. It
distinctly takes the ground that the habitual offering
of these was pleasing to the Judge. Their presentation
continually is not reproved, but approved. What
then is condemned? Surely it can be nothing but
sacrifice without the thanksgiving and prayer required
in vv. 14, 15. The irony of vv. 9-13 is directed
against the folly of believing that in sacrifice itself
God delighted; but the shafts are pointless as against
offerings which are embodied gratitude and trust. The
gross stupidity of supposing that man's gift makes the
offering to be God's more truly than before is laid
bare in the fine, sympathetic glance at the free, wild
life of forest, mountain, and plain, which is all God's
possession, and present to His upholding thought, and
by the side of which man's folds are very small affairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
"The cattle" in ver. 10 are not, as usually, domesticated
animals, but the larger wild animals. They
graze or roam "on the mountains of a thousand"&mdash;a
harsh expression, best taken, perhaps, as meaning
mountains where thousands [of the cattle] are. But
the omission of one letter gives the more natural
reading "mountains of God" (<i>cf.</i> Psalm xxxvi. 6). It
is adopted by Olshausen and Cheyne, and smooths
the construction, but has against it its obliteration of
the fine thought of the multitudes of creatures peopling
the untravelled hills. The word rendered "whatever
moves" is obscure; but that meaning is accepted by
most. Cheyne in his Commentary gives as alternative
"that which comes forth abundantly," and in "Orig.
of Psalt.," 473, "offspring." All these are "with Me"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
present to His mind&mdash;a parallel to "I know" in
the first clause of the same verse.</p>

<p>Vv. 12, 13, turn the stream of irony on another
absurdity involved in the superstition attacked&mdash;the
grossly material thought of God involved in it. What
good do bulls' flesh and goats' blood do to Him? But
if these are expressions of thankful love, they are
delightsome to Him. Therefore the section ends with
the declaration that the true sacrifice is thanksgiving
and the discharge of vows. Men honour God by
asking and taking, not by giving. They glorify Him
when, by calling on Him in trouble, they are delivered;
and then, by thankfulness and service, as well as by
the evidence which their experience gives that prayer
is not in vain, they again glorify Him. All sacrifices
are God's before they are offered, and do not become
any more His by being offered. He neither needs nor
can partake of material sustenance. But men's hearts
are not His without their glad surrender, in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
way as after it; and thankful love, trust, and obedience
are as the food of God, sacrifices acceptable, well-pleasing
to Him.</p>

<p>The third part of the psalm is still sterner in tone.
It strikes at the other great corruption of worship by
hypocrites. As has been often remarked, it condemns
breaches of the second table of the law, just as the
former part may be regarded as dealing with transgressions
of the first. The eighth, seventh, and ninth commandments
are referred to in vv. 18, 19, as examples
of the hypocrites' sins. The irreconcilable contradiction
of their professions and conduct is vividly brought out
in the juxtaposition of "declare My statutes" and
"castest My words behind thee." They do two opposite
things with the same words&mdash;at the same time proclaiming
them with all lip-reverence, and scornfully
flinging them behind their backs in their conduct. The
word rendered in the A.V. "slanderest" is better taken
as in margin of the R.V., "givest a thrust," meaning to
use violence so as to harm or overthrow.</p>

<p>Hypocrisy finds encouragement in impunity. God's
silence is an emphatic way of expressing His patient
tolerance of evil unpunished. Such "long-suffering"
is meant to lead to repentance, and indicates God's
unwillingness to smite. But, as experience shows, it
is often abused, and "because sentence against an evil
work is not executed speedily, the heart of the sons of
men is throughly set in them to do evil." The gross
mind has gross conceptions of God. One nemesis of
hypocrisy is the dimming of the idea of the righteous
Judge. All sin darkens the image of God. When men
turn away from God's self-revelation, as they do by
transgression and most fatally by hypocrisy, they cannot
but make a God after their own image. Browning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
has taught us in his marvellous "Caliban on Setebos"
how a coarse nature projects its own image into the
heavens and calls it God. God made man in His own
likeness. Men who have lost that likeness make God
in theirs, and so sink deeper in evil till He speaks.
Then comes an apocalypse to the dreamer, when there
is flashed before him what God is and what he himself
is. How terror-stricken the gaze of these eyes before
which God arrays the deeds of a life, seen for the first
time in their true character! It will be the hypocrite's
turn to keep silence then, and his thought of a complaisant
God like himself will perish before the stern
reality.</p>

<p>The whole teaching of the psalm is gathered up in
the two closing verses. "Ye that forget God" includes
both the superstitious formalists and the hypocrites.
Reflection upon such truths as those of the psalm will
save them from else inevitable destruction. "This"
points on to ver. 23, which is a compendium of both
parts of the psalm. The true worship, which consists
in thankfulness and praise, is opposed in ver. 23 <i>a</i> to
mere externalisms of sacrifice, as being the right way
of glorifying God. The second clause presents a difficulty.
But it would seem that we must expect to find
in it a summing up of the warning of the third part
of the psalm similar to that of the second part in the
preceding clause. That consideration goes against the
rendering in the R.V. margin (adopted from Delitzsch):
"and prepares a way [by which] I may show," etc.
The ellipsis of the relative is also somewhat harsh.
The literal rendering of the ambiguous words is, "one
setting a way." Graetz, who is often wild in his
emendations, proposes a very slight one here&mdash;the
change of one letter, which would yield a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
meaning: "he that is perfect in his way." Cheyne
adopts this, and it eases a difficulty. But the received
text is capable of the rendering given in the A.V.,
and, even without the natural supplement "aright," is
sufficiently intelligible. To order one's way or "conversation"
is, of course, equivalent to giving heed to it
according to God's word, and is the opposite of the
conduct stigmatised in vv. 16-21. The promise to him
who thus acts is that he shall see God's salvation, both
in the narrower sense of daily interpositions for deliverance,
and in the wider of a full and final rescue from
all evil and endowment with all good. The psalm has
as keen an edge for modern as for ancient sins.
Superstitious reliance on externals of worship survives,
though sacrifices have ceased; and hypocrites, with
their mouths full of the Gospel, still cast God's words
behind them, as did those ancient hollow-hearted
proclaimers and breakers of the Law.</p>

<p>The main grounds on which the Davidic authorship
of this psalm is denied are four. First, it is
alleged that its conceptions of sin and penitence are in
advance of his stage of religious development; or, as
Cheyne puts it, "David could not have had these ideas"
("Aids to Dev. Study of Crit.," 166). The impossibility
depends on a theory which is not yet so established
as to be confidently used to settle questions of date.
Again, the psalmist's wail, "Against Thee only have I
sinned," is said to be conclusive proof that the wrong
done to Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah cannot be
referred to. But is not <i>God</i> the correlative of <i>sin</i>, and
may not the same act be qualified in one aspect as a
crime and in another as a sin, bearing in the latter
character exclusive relation to God? The prayer in
ver. 18 is the ground of a third objection to the Davidic
authorship. Certainly it is hopeless to attempt to
explain. "Build the walls of Jerusalem" as David's
prayer. But the opinion held by both advocates and
opponents of David's authorship, that vv. 18, 19, are
a later liturgical addition, removes this difficulty.
Another ground on which the psalm is brought down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
to a late date is the resemblances in it to Isa. xl.-lxvi.,
which are taken to be echoes of the prophetic words.
The resemblances are undoubted; the assumption that
the psalmist is the copyist is not.</p>

<p>The personified nation is supposed by most modern
authorities to be the speaker; and the date is sometimes
taken to be the Restoration period, before the rebuilding
of the walls by Nehemiah (Cheyne, "Orig. of Psalt.,"
162); by others, the time of the Babylonish exile; and,
as usual, by some, the Maccabean epoch. It puts a considerable
strain upon the theory of personification to
believe that these confessions of personal sin, and longing
cries for a clean heart, which so many generations
have felt to fit their most secret experiences, were not the
wailings of a soul which had learned the burden of individuality,
by consciousness of sin, and by realisation of
the awful solitude of its relation to God. There are also
expressions in the psalm which seem to clog the supposition
that the speaker is the nation with great difficulties&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
the reference to birth in ver. 5, the prayer for
inward truth in ver. 6, and for a clean heart in ver. 10.
Baethgen acknowledges that the two latter only receive
their full meaning when applied to an individual. He
quotes Olshausen, a defender of the national reference,
who really admits the force of the objection to it, raised
on the ground of these expressions, while he seeks to
parry it by saying that "it is not unnatural that the
poet, speaking in the singular, should, although he writes
for the congregation, bring in occasional expressions
here and there which do not fit the community so well
as they do each individual in it." The acknowledgment
is valuable; the attempt to turn its edge may be
left to the reader's judgment.</p>

<p>In vv. 1-9 the psalmist's cry is chiefly for pardon; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
vv. 10-12 he prays chiefly for purity; in vv. 13-17 he
vows grateful service. Vv. 18, 19, are probably a later
addition.</p>

<p>The psalm begins with at once grasping the
character of God as the sole ground of hope. That
character has been revealed in an infinite number of
acts of love. The very number of the psalmist's sins
drove him to contemplate the yet greater number of
God's mercies. For where but in an infinite placableness
and loving-kindness could he find pardon? If the
Davidic authorship is adopted, this psalm followed
Nathan's assurance of forgiveness, and its petitions are
the psalmist's efforts to lay hold of that assurance.
The revelation of God's love precedes and causes true
penitence. Our prayer for forgiveness is the appropriation
of God's promise of forgiveness. The assurance
of pardon does not lead to a light estimate of sin, but
drives it home to the conscience.</p>

<p>The petitions of vv. 1, 2, teach us how the psalmist
thought of sin. They are all substantially the same,
and their repetition discloses the depth of longing in
the suppliant. The language fluctuates between plural
and singular nouns, designating the evil as "transgressions"
and as "iniquity" and "sin." The psalmist
regards it, first, as a multitude of separate acts, then
as all gathered together into a grim unity. The single
deeds of wrong-doing pass before him. But these have
a common root; and we must not only recognise acts,
but that alienation of heart from which they come&mdash;not
only sin as it comes out in the life, but as it is coiled
round our hearts. Sins are the manifestations of sin.</p>

<p>We note, too, how the psalmist realises his personal
responsibility. He reiterates "my"&mdash;"<i>my</i> transgressions,
<i>my</i> iniquity, <i>my</i> sin." He does not throw blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
on circumstances, or talk about temperament or maxims
of society or bodily organisation. All these had some
share in impelling him to sin; but after all allowance
made for them, the deed is the doer's, and he must
bear its burden.</p>

<p>The same eloquent synonyms for evil deeds which
are found in Psalm xxxii. occur again here. "Transgression"
is literally <i>rebellion</i>; "iniquity," <i>that which
is twisted</i> or <i>bent</i>; "sin," <i>missing a mark</i>. Sin is
rebellion, the uprising of the will against rightful
authority&mdash;not merely the breach of abstract propriety
or law, but opposition to a living Person, who has right
to obedience. The definition of virtue is obedience to
God, and the sin in sin is the assertion of independence
of God and opposition to His will.</p>

<p>Not less profound is that other name, which regards
sin as "iniquity" or distortion. Then there is a
straight line to which men's lives should run parallel.
Our life's paths should be like these conquering Roman
roads, turning aside for nothing, but going straight
to their aim over mountain and ravine, stream or
desert. But this man's passion had made for him a
crooked path, where he found no end, "in wandering
mazes lost." Sin is, further, missing an aim, the aim
being either the Divine purpose for man, the true Ideal
of manhood, or the satisfaction proposed by the sinner
to himself as the result of his sin. In both senses
every sin misses the mark.</p>

<p>These petitions show also how the psalmist thought
of forgiveness. As the words for sin give a threefold
view of it, so those for pardon set it forth in three
aspects. "Blot out";&mdash;that petition conceives of forgiveness
as being the erasure of a writing, perhaps of an
indictment. Our past is a blurred manuscript, full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
false and bad things. The melancholy theory of some
thinkers is summed up in the despairing words, "What
I have written, I have written." But the psalmist knew
better than that; and we should know better than he
did. Our souls may become palimpsests; and, as devotional
meditations might be written by a saint on a
parchment that had borne foul legends of false gods, the
bad writing on them may be obliterated, and God's law
be written there. "Wash me thoroughly" needs no
explanation. But the word employed is significant, in
that it probably means washing by kneading or beating,
not by simple rinsing. The psalmist is ready to submit
to any painful discipline, if only he may be cleansed.
"Wash me, beat me, tread me down, hammer me with
mallets, dash me against stones, do anything with me,
if only these foul stains are melted from the texture of
my soul." The psalmist had not heard of the alchemy
by which men can "wash their robes and make them
white in the blood of the Lamb"; but he held fast by
God's "loving-kindness," and knew the blackness of
his own sin, and groaned under it; and therefore his
cry was not in vain. An anticipation of the Christian
teaching as to forgiveness lies in his last expression for
pardon, "make me clean," which is the technical word
for the priestly act of declaring ceremonial purity, and
for the other priestly act of making as well as declaring
clean from the stains of leprosy. The suppliant thinks
of his guilt not only as a blotted record or as a polluted
robe, but as a fatal disease, the "first-born of death,"
and as capable of being taken away only by the hand
of the Priest laid on the feculent mass. We know who
put out his hand and touched the leper, and said, "I
will: be thou clean."</p>

<p>The petitions for cleansing are, in ver. 3, urged on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the ground of the psalmist's consciousness of sin.
Penitent confession is a condition of forgiveness.
There is no need to take this verse as giving the
reason why the psalmist offered his prayer, rather
than as presenting a plea why it should be answered.
Some commentators have adopted the former explanation,
from a fear lest the other should give countenance
to the notion that repentance is a meritorious cause
of forgiveness; but that is unnecessary scrupulousness.
"Sin is always sin, and deserving of punishment,
whether it is confessed or not. Still, confession of
sin is of importance on this account&mdash;that God will be
gracious to none but to those who confess their sin"
(Luther, quoted by Perowne).</p>

<p>Ver. 4 sounds the depths in both its clauses. In
the first the psalmist shuts out all other aspects of his
guilt, and is absorbed in its solemnity as viewed in
relation to God. It is asked, How could David have
thought of his sin, which had in so many ways been
"against" others, as having been "against Thee, Thee
only"? As has been noted above, this confession has
been taken to demonstrate conclusively the impossibility
of the Davidic authorship. But surely it argues a
strange ignorance of the language of a penitent soul,
to suppose that such words as the psalmist's could be
spoken only in regard to sins which had no bearing
at all on other men. David's deed had been a crime
against Bathsheba, against Uriah, against his family
and his realm; but these were not its blackest characteristics.
Every crime against man is sin against God.
"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
these ... ye have done it unto Me" is the spirit of
the Decalogue as well as the language of Jesus. And it
is only when considered as having relation to God that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
crimes are darkened into sins. The psalmist is stating
a strictly true and profound thought when he declares
that he has sinned "against Thee only." Further, that
thought has, for the time being, filled his whole horizon.
Other aspects of his shameful deed will torture him
enough in coming days, even when he has fully entered
into the blessedness of forgiveness; but they are not
present to his mind now, when the one awful thought
of his perverted relation to God swallows up all others.
A man who has never felt that all-engrossing sense of
his sin as against God only has much to learn.</p>

<p>The second clause of ver. 4 opens the question
whether "in order that" is always used in the Old
Testament in its full meaning as expressing intention,
or sometimes in the looser signification of "so that,"
expressing result. Several passages usually referred
to on this point (<i>e.g.</i>, Psalm xxx. 12; Exod. xi. 9; Isa.
xliv. 9; Hos. viii. 4) strongly favour the less stringent
view, which is also in accordance with the genius of
the Hebrew race, who were not metaphysicians. The
other view, that the expression here means "in order
that," insists on grammatical precision in the cries of a
penitent heart, and clogs the words with difficulty. If
their meaning is that the psalmist's sin was intended to
show forth God's righteousness in judging, the intention
must have been God's, not the sinner's; and such a
thought not only ascribes man's sin directly to God, but
is quite irrelevant to the psalmist's purpose in the words.
For he is not palliating his transgression or throwing it
on Divine predestination (as Cheyne takes him to be
doing), but is submitting himself, in profoundest abasement
of undivided guilt, to the just judgment of God.
His prayer for forgiveness is accompanied with willingness
to submit to chastisement, as all true desire for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
pardon is. He makes no excuses for his sin, but
submits himself unconditionally to the just judgment
of God. "Thou remainest the Holy One; I am the
sinner; and therefore Thou mayest, with perfect justice,
punish me and spurn me from Thy presence" (Stier).</p>

<p>Vv. 5, 6, are marked as closely related by the
"Behold" at the beginning of each. The psalmist
passes from penitent contemplation and confession of
his acts of sin to acknowledge his sinful nature, derived
from sinful parents. "Original sin" is theological terminology
for the same facts which science gathers
together under the name of "heredity." The psalmist
is not responsible for later dogmatic developments of
the idea, but he feels that he has to confess not only
his acts but his nature. "A corrupt tree cannot bring
forth good fruit." The taint is transmitted. No fact
is more plain than this, as all the more serious
observers of human life and of their own characters
have recognised. Only a superficial view of humanity
or an inadequate conception of morality can jauntily
say that "all children are born good." Theologians
have exaggerated and elaborated, as is their wont, and
so have made the thought repugnant; but the derived
sinful bias of human nature is a fact, not a dogma, and
those who know it and their own share of it best will
be disposed to agree with Browning, in finding one
great reason for believing in Biblical religion, that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis the faith that launched point-blank her dart<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At the head of a lie&mdash;taught Original Sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Corruption of Man's Heart."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The psalmist is not, strictly speaking, either extenuating
or aggravating his sin by thus recognising his
evil nature. He does not think that sin is the less his,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
because the tendency has been inherited. But he is
spreading all his condition before God. In fact, he
is not so much thinking of his criminality as of his
desperate need. From a burden so heavy and so intertwined
with himself none but God can deliver him.
He cannot cleanse himself; for self is infected. He
cannot find cleansing among men, for they too have
inherited the poison. And so he is driven to God, or
else must sink into despair. He who once sees into
the black depths of his own heart will give up thereafter
all ideas of "every man his own redeemer." That the
psalmist's purpose was not to minimise his own guilt
is clear, not only from the tone of the psalm, but from
the antithesis presented by the Divine desire after
inward truth in the next verse, which is out of place
if this verse contains a palliation for sin.</p>

<p>We can scarcely miss the bearing of this verse on
the question of whether the psalm is the confession of
an individual penitent or that of the nation. It strongly
favours the former view, though it does not make the
latter absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>The discovery of inherent and inherited sinfulness
brings with it another discovery&mdash;that of the penetrating
depth of the requirements of God's law. He cannot be
satisfied with outside conformity in deed. The more
intensely conscience realises sin, the more solemnly
rises before it the Divine ideal of man in its inwardness
as well as in its sweep. Truth within&mdash;inward correspondence
with His will, and absolute sincerity of soul
are His desire. But I am "born in iniquity": a terrible
antithesis, and hopeless but for one hope, which dawns
over the suppliant like morning on a troubled sea.
If we cannot ask God to make us what He wishes us
to be, these two discoveries of our nature and of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
will are open doorways to despair; but he who apprehends
them wisely will find in their conjoint operation
a force impelling him to prayer, and therefore to confidence.
Only God can enable such a Being as man to
become such as He will delight in; and since He seeks
for truth within, He thereby pledges Himself to give
the truth and wisdom for which He seeks.</p>

<p>Meditation on the sin which was ever before the
psalmist, passes into renewed prayers for pardon,
which partly reiterate those already offered in vv. 1, 2.
The petition in ver. 7 for purging with hyssop alludes
to sprinkling of lepers and unclean persons, and indicates
both a consciousness of great impurity and a clear
perception of the symbolic meaning of ritual cleansings.
"Wash me" repeats a former petition; but now the
psalmist can venture to dwell more on the thought of
future purity than he could do then. The approaching
answer begins to make its brightness visible through
the gloom, and it seems possible to the suppliant that
even his stained nature shall glisten like sunlit snow.
Nor does that expectation exhaust his confidence. He
hopes for "joy and gladness." His bones have been
crushed&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, his whole self has been, as it were, ground
to powder by the weight of God's hand; but restoration
is possible. A penitent heart is not too bold when it
asks for joy. There is no real well-founded gladness
without the consciousness of Divine forgiveness. The
psalmist closes his petitions for pardon (ver. 9) with
asking God to "hide His face from his sins," so that
they be, as it were, no more existent for Him, and,
by a repetition of the initial petition in ver. 1, for the
blotting out of "all mine iniquities."</p>

<p>The second principal division begins with ver. 10,
and is a prayer for purity, followed by vows of glad service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
The prayer is contained in three verses (10-12),
of which the first implores complete renewal of nature,
the second beseeches that there may be no break
between the suppliant and God, and the third asks for
the joy and willingness to serve which would flow
from the granting of the desires preceding. In each
verse the second clause has "spirit" for its leading
word, and the middle one of the three asks for "<i>Thy</i>
holy spirit." The petitions themselves, and the order
in which they occur, are deeply significant, and deserve
much more elucidation than can be given here. The
same profound consciousness of inward corruption
which spoke in the former part of the psalm shapes the
prayer for renewal. Nothing less than a new creation
will make this man's heart "clean." His past has
taught him that. The word employed is always used
of God's creative act; and the psalmist feels that nothing
less than the power which brooded over the face of
primeval chaos, and evolved thence an ordered world,
can deal with the confused ruin within himself. What
he felt that he must have is what prophets promised
(Jer. xxiv. 7; Ezek. xxxvi. 26) and Christ has brought&mdash;a
new creation, in which, while personality remains
unaffected, and the components of character continue
as before, a real new life is bestowed, which stamps
new directions on affections, gives new aims, impulses,
convictions, casts out inveterate evils, and gradually
changes "all but the basis of the soul." A desire for
pardon which does not unfold into such longing for
deliverance from the misery of the old self is not the
offspring of genuine penitence, but only of base fear.</p>

<p>"A steadfast spirit" is needful in order to keep a
cleansed heart clean; and, on the other hand, when, by
cleanness of heart, a man is freed from the perturbations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of rebellious desires and the weakening influences
of sin, his spirit will be steadfast. The two characteristics
sustain each other. Consciousness of corruption
dictated the former desire; penitent recognition of
weakness and fluctuation inspires the latter. It may be
observed, too, that the triad of petitions having reference
to "spirit" has for its central one a prayer for God's
Spirit, and that the other two may be regarded as
dependent on that. Where God's Spirit dwells, the
human spirit in which it abides will be firm with uncreated
strength. His energy, being infused into a
tremulous, changeful humanity, will make it stable. If
we are to stand fast, we must be stayed on God.</p>

<p>The group of petitions in ver. 11 is negative. It
deprecates a possible tragic separation from God, and
that under two aspects. "Part me not from Thee;
part not Thyself from me." The former prayer, "Cast
me not out from Thy presence," is by some explained
according to the analogy of other instances of the
occurrence of the phrase, where it means expulsion
from the land of Israel; and is claimed, thus interpreted,
as a clear indication that the psalmist speaks in
the name of the nation. But however certainly the
expression is thus used elsewhere, it cannot, without
introducing an alien thought, be so interpreted in its
present connection, imbedded in petitions of the most
spiritual and individual character: much rather, the
psalmist is recoiling from what he knows only too well to
be the consequence of an unclean heart&mdash;separation from
God, whether in the sense of exclusion from the sanctuary,
or in the profounder sense, which is not too deep
for such a psalm, of conscious loss of the light of God's
face. He dreads being, Cain-like, shut out from that
presence which is life; and he knows that, unless his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
previous prayer for a clean heart is answered, that
dreary solitude of great darkness must be his lot. The
sister petition, "Take not Thy holy spirit from me,"
contemplates the union between God and him from
the other side. He regards himself as possessing that
Divine spirit; for he knows that, notwithstanding his
sin, God has not left him, else he would not have these
movements of godly sorrow and yearnings for purity.
There is no reason to commit the anachronism of supposing
that the psalmist had any knowledge of New
Testament teaching of a personal Divine Spirit. But
if we may suppose that he is David, this prayer has
special force. That anointing which designated and
fitted him for kingly office symbolised the gift of a
Divine influence accompanying a Divine call. If we
further remember how it had fared with his predecessor,
from whom, because of impenitence, "the Spirit of the
Lord departed, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled
him," we understand how Saul's successor, trembling
as he remembers his fate, prays with peculiar emphasis,
"Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me."</p>

<p>The last member of the triad, in ver. 12, looks back
to former petitions, and asks for restoration of the "joy
of Thy salvation," which had lain like dew on this man
before he fell. In this connection the supplication for
joy follows on the other two, because the joy which it
desires is the result of their being granted. For what
is "Thy salvation" but the gift of a clean heart and a
steadfast spirit, the blessed consciousness of unbroken
closeness of communion with God, in which the suppliant
suns himself in the beams of God's face, and
receives an uninterrupted communication of His Spirit's
gifts? These are the sources of pure joy, lasting as
God Himself, and victorious over all occasions for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
surface sorrow. The issue of all these gifts will be
"a willing spirit," delighting to obey, eager to serve.
If God's Spirit dwells in us, obedience will be delight.
To serve God because we must is not service. To
serve Him because we had rather do His will than
anything else is the service which delights Him
and blesses us. The word rendered "willing" comes
by a very natural process, to mean nobles. God's
servants are princes and lords of everything besides,
themselves included. Such obedience is freedom. If
desires flow with equable motion parallel to God's will,
there is no sense of restraint in keeping within limits
beyond which we do not desire to go. "I will walk at
liberty; for I keep Thy precepts."</p>

<p>The last part of the psalm runs over with joyful
vows&mdash;first, of magnifying God's name (vv. 13-15),
and then of offering true sacrifices. A man who has
passed through such experiences as the psalmist's,
and has received the blessings for which he prayed,
cannot be silent. The instinct of hearts touched by
God's mercies is to speak of them to others. And no
man who can say "I will tell what He has done for
my soul" is without the most persuasive argument to
bring to bear on others. A piece of autobiography will
touch men who are unaffected by elaborate reasonings
and deaf to polished eloquence. The impulse and the
capacity to "teach transgressors Thy ways" are given
in the experience of sin and forgiveness; and if any
one has not the former, it is questionable whether he
has, in any real sense or large measure, received the
latter. The prayer for deliverance from blood-guiltiness
in ver. 14 breaks for a moment the flow of vows; but
only for a moment. It indicates how amid them the
psalmist preserved his sense of guilt, and how little he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
was disposed to think lightly of the sins of whose
forgiveness he had prayed himself into the assurance.
Its emergence here, like a black rock pushing its
grimness up through a sparkling, sunny sea, is no sign
of doubt whether his prayers had been answered; but
it marks the abiding sense of sinfulness, which must
ever accompany abiding gratitude for pardon and abiding
holiness of heart. It seems hard to believe, as the
advocates of a national reference in the psalm are
obliged to do, that "blood-guiltiness" has no special
reference to the psalmist's crime, but is employed
simply as typical of sin in general. The mention of
it finds a very obvious explanation on the hypothesis
of Davidic authorship, and a rather constrained one on
any other.</p>

<p>Ver. 16 introduces the reason for the preceding vow
of grateful praise, as is shown by the initial "For."
The psalmist will bring the sacrifices of a grateful
heart making his lips musical, because he has learned
that these, and not ritual offerings, are acceptable.
The same depreciation of external sacrifices is strongly
expressed in Psalm xl. 6, and here, as there, is not
to be taken as an absolute condemnation of these, but
as setting them decisively below spiritual service. To
suppose that prophets or psalmists waged a polemic
against ritual observances <i>per se</i> misapprehends their
position entirely. They do war against "the sacrifice
of the wicked," against external acts which had no
inward reality corresponding to them, against reliance
on the outward and its undue exaltation. The authors
of the later addition to this psalm had a true conception
of its drift when they appended to it, not as a
correction of a heretical tendency, but as a liturgical
addition in full harmony with its spirit, the vow to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
"offer whole burnt offerings on" the restored "altar,"
when God should again build up Zion.</p>

<p>The psalmist's last words are immortal. "A heart
broken and crushed, O God, Thou wilt not despise."
But they derive still deeper beauty and pathos when
it is observed that they are spoken after confession
has been answered to his consciousness by pardon,
and longing for purity by at least some bestowal of
it. The "joy of Thy salvation," for which he had
prayed, has begun to flow into his heart. The
"bones" which had been "crushed" are beginning
to reknit, and thrills of gladness to steal through his
frame; but still he feels that with all these happy
experiences contrite consciousness of his sin must
mingle. It does not rob his joy of one rapture, but it
keeps it from becoming careless. He goes safely who
goes humbly. The more sure a man is that God has
put away the iniquity of his sin, the more should he
remember it; for the remembrance will vivify gratitude
and bind close to Him without whom there can be no
steadfastness of spirit nor purity of life. The clean
heart must continue contrite, if it is not to cease to be
clean.</p>

<p>The liturgical addition implies that Jerusalem is in
ruins. It cannot be supposed without violence to
come from David. It is not needed in order to form a
completion to the psalm, which ends more impressively,
and has an inner unity and coherence, if the deep
words of ver. 17 are taken as its close.</p>

<p>The progress of feeling in this psalm is clear, but
there is no very distinct division into strophes,
and one of the two Selahs does not mark a transition,
though it does make a pause. First, the poet, with
a few indignant and contemptuous touches, dashes on
his canvas an outline portrait of an arrogant oppressor,
whose weapon was slander and his words like pits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
ruin. Then, with vehement, exulting metaphors, he
pictures his destruction. On it follow reverent awe of
God, whose justice is thereby displayed, and deepened
sense in righteous hearts of the folly of trust in anything
but Him. Finally, the singer contrasts with
thankfulness his own happy continuance in fellowship
with God with the oppressor's fate, and renews his
resolve of praise and patient waiting.</p>

<p>The themes are familiar, and their treatment has
nothing distinctive. The portrait of the oppressor does
not strike one as a likeness either of the Edomite
herdsman Doeg, with whose betrayal of David's asylum
at Nob the superscription connects the psalm, or of
Saul, to whom Hengstenberg, feeling the difficulty
of seeing Doeg in it, refers it. Malicious lies and
arrogant trust in riches were not the crimes that cried
for vengeance in the bloody massacre at Nob. Cheyne
would bring this group of "Davidic" psalms (lii.-lix.)
down to the Persian period ("Orig. of Psalt.," 121-23).
Olshausen, after Theodore of Mopsuestia (see Cheyne
<i>loc. cit.</i>) to the Maccabean. But the grounds alleged are
scarcely strong enough to carry more than the weight
of a "may be"; and it is better to recognise that, if the
superscription is thrown over, the psalm itself does not
yield sufficiently characteristic marks to enable us to
fix its date. It may be worth considering whether the
very absence of any obvious correspondences with
David's circumstances does not show that the superscription
rested on a tradition earlier than itself, and
not on an editor's discernment.</p>

<p>The abrupt question at the beginning reveals the
psalmist's long-pent indignation. He has been silently
brooding over the swollen arrogance and malicious lies
of the tyrant, till he can restrain himself no longer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
out pours a fiery flood. Evil gloried in is worse than
evil done. The word rendered in the A.V. and R.V.
"mighty man" is here used in a bad sense, to indicate
that he has not only a giant's power, but uses it tyrannously,
like a giant. How dramatically the abrupt
question is followed by the equally abrupt thought of
the ever-during loving-kindness of God! That makes
the tyrant's boast supremely absurd, and the psalmist's
confidence reasonable, even in face of hostile power.</p>

<p>The prominence given to sins of speech is peculiar.
We should have expected high-handed violence rather
than these. But the psalmist is tracking the deeds to
their source; and it is not so much the tyrant's words
as his love of a certain kind of words which is adduced
as proof of his wickedness. These words have two
characteristics in addition to boastfulness. They are
false and destructive. They are, according to the
forcible literal meaning in ver. 4, "words of swallowing."
They are, according to the literal meaning of
"destructions," in ver. 2, "yawning gulfs." Such
words lead to acts which make a tyrant. They flow
from perverted preference of evil to good. Thus the
deeds of oppression are followed up to their den and
birthplace. Part of the description of the "words"
corresponds to the fatal effect of Doeg's report; but
nothing in it answers to the other part&mdash;falsehood.
The psalmist's hot indignation speaks in the triple,
direct address to the tyrant, which comes in each case
like a lightning flash at the end of a clause (vv. 1, 2,
4). In the second of these the epithet "framing
deceit" does not refer to the "sharpened razor," but
to the tyrant. If referred to the former, it weakens
rather than strengthens the metaphor, by bringing in
the idea that the sharp blade misses its proper aim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
and wounds cheeks instead of shearing off hair. The
Selah of ver. 3 interrupts the description, in order to
fix attention, by a pause filled up by music, on the
hideous picture thus drawn.</p>

<p>That description is resumed and summarised in ver. 4,
which, by the Selahs, is closely bound to ver. 5, in
order to enforce the necessary connection of sin and
punishment, which is strongly underlined by the
"also" or "so" at the beginning of the latter verse.
The stern prophecy of destruction is based upon no
outward signs of failure in the oppressor's might, but
wholly on confidence in God's continual loving-kindness,
which must needs assume attributes of justice when
its objects are oppressed. A tone of triumph vibrates
through the imagery of ver. 5, which is not in the same
key as Christ has set for us.</p>

<p>It is easy for those who have never lived under
grinding, godless tyranny to reprobate the exultation
of the oppressed at the sweeping away of their
oppressors; but if the critics had seen their brethren
set up as torches to light Nero's gardens, perhaps they
would have known some thrill of righteous joy when
they heard that he was dead. Three strong metaphors
describe the fall of this tyrant. He is broken down, as
a building levelled with the ground. He is laid hold
of, as a coal in the fire, with tongs (for so the word
means), and dragged, as in that iron grip, out of the
midst of his dwelling. He is uprooted like a tree with
all its pride of leafage. Another blast of trumpets or
clang of harps or clash of cymbals bids the listeners
gaze on the spectacle of insolent strength laid prone,
and withering as it lies.</p>

<p>The third movement of thought (vv. 6, 7) deals with
the effects of this retribution. It is a conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
demonstration of God's justice and of the folly of
reliance on anything but Himself. The fear which it
produces in the "righteous" is reverential awe, not
dread lest the same should happen to them. Whether
or not history and experience teach evil men that
"verily there is a God that judgeth," their lessons are
not wasted on devout and righteous souls. But this
is the tragedy of life, that its teachings are prized most
by those who have already learned them, and that
those who need them most consider them least. Other
tyrants are glad when a rival is swept off the field, but
are not arrested in their own course. It is left to "the
righteous" to draw the lesson which all men should
have learned. Although they are pictured as laughing
at the ruin, that is not the main effect of it. Rather
it deepens conviction, and is a "modern instance" witnessing
to the continual truth of "an old saw." There
is one safe stronghold, and only one. He who conceits
himself to be strong in his own evil, and, instead of
relying on God, trusts in material resources, will sooner
or later be levelled with the ground, dragged, resisting
vainly the tremendous grasp, from his tent, and laid
prostrate, as melancholy a spectacle as a great tree
blown down by tempest, with its roots turned up to
the sky and its arms with drooping leaves trailing on
the ground.</p>

<p>A swift turn of feeling carries the singer to rejoice
in the contrast of his own lot. No uprooting does he
fear. It may be questioned whether the words "in
the house of God" refer to the psalmist or to the olive
tree. Apparently there were trees in the Temple area
(Psalm xcii. 13); but the parallel in the next clause, "in
the loving-kindness of God," points to the reference of
the words to the speaker. Dwelling in enjoyment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
God's fellowship, as symbolised by and realised through
presence in the sanctuary, whether it were at Nob or in
Jerusalem, he dreads no such forcible removal as had
befallen the tyrant. Communion with God is the source
of flourishing and fruitfulness, and the guarantee of
its own continuance. Nothing in the changes of outward
life need touch it. The mists which lay on the
psalmist's horizon are cleared away for us, who know
that "for ever and aye" designates a proper eternity of
dwelling in the higher house and drinking the full dew
of God's loving-kindness. Such consciousness of present
blessedness in communion lifts a soul to prophetic
realisation of deliverance, even while no change has
occurred in circumstances. The tyrant is still boasting;
but the psalmist's tightened hold of God enables him
to see "things that are not as though they were," and
to anticipate actual deliverance by praise for it. It is
the prerogative of faith to alter tenses, and to say,
Thou hast done, when the world's grammar would say,
Thou wilt do. "I will <i>wait on</i> Thy name" is singular,
since what is done "in the presence of Thy favoured
ones" would naturally be something seen or heard by
them. The reading "I will declare" has been suggested.
But surely the attitude of patient, silent
expectance implied in "wait" may very well be conceived
as maintained in the presence of, and perceptible
by, those who had like dispositions, and who would
sympathise and be helped thereby. Individual blessings
are rightly used when they lead to participation in
common thankfulness and quiet trust.</p>

<p>In this psalm we have an Elohistic recast of Psalm
xiv., differing from its original in substituting
Elohim for Jehovah (four times) and in the language
of ver. 5. There are also other slight deviations not
affecting the sense. For the exposition the reader is
referred to that of Psalm xiv. It is only necessary
here to take note of the divergences.</p>

<p>The first of these occurs in ver. 1. The forcible
rough construction "they corrupt, they make abominable,"
is smoothed down by the insertion of "and."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
The editor apparently thought that the loosely piled
words needed a piece of mortar to hold them together,
but his emendation weakens as well as smooths. On
the other hand, he has aimed at increased energy of
expression by substituting "iniquity" for "doings"
in the same clause, which results in tautology and is
no improvement. In ver. 3 the word for "turned
aside" is varied, without substantial difference of meaning.
The alteration is very slight, affecting only one
letter, and may be due to error in transcription or to
mere desire to emend. In ver. 4 "all," which in
Psalm xiv. precedes "workers of iniquity," is omitted,
probably as unnecessary.</p>

<p>The most important changes are in ver. 5, which
stands for vv. 5 and 6 of Psalm xiv. The first is the
insertion of "where no fear was." These words may
be taken as describing causeless panic, or, less probably,
as having a subjective reference, and being equal
to "while in the midst of careless security." They
evidently point to some fact, possibly the destruction
of Sennacherib's army. Their insertion shows that the
object of the alterations was to adapt an ancient psalm
as a hymn of triumph for recent deliverance, thus altering
its application from evil-doers within Israel to
enemies without. The same purpose is obvious in
the transformations effected in the remainder of this
verse. Considerable as these are, the recast most
ingeniously conforms to the sound of the original. If
we could present the two versions in tabular form, the
resemblance would appear more strikingly than we can
here bring it out. The first variation&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, "scatters"
instead of "in the generation"&mdash;is effected by reading
"pizzar" for "b'dhor," a clear case of intentional
assonance. Similarly the last word of the verse, "has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
rejected them," is very near in consonants and sound
to "his refuge" in Psalm xiv. 6. The like effort at
retaining the general sound of the earlier psalm runs
through the whole verse. Very significantly the complaint
of the former singer is turned into triumph by
the later, who addresses the delivered Israel with "Thou
hast put them to shame," while the other psalm could
but address the "fools" with "Ye would put to shame
the counsel of the afflicted." In like manner the tremulous
hope of the original, "God is his refuge," swells
into commemoration of an accomplished fact in "God
has rejected them." The natural supposition is that
some great deliverance of Israel had just taken place,
and inspired this singular attempt to fit old words to
new needs. Whatever the historical occasion may
have been, the two singers unite in one final aspiration,
a sigh of longing for the coming of Israel's full salvation,
which is intensified in the recast by being put in
the plural ("salvations") instead of the singular, as in
Psalm xiv., to express the completeness and manifoldness
of the deliverance thus yearned for of old, and not
yet come in its perfection.</p>

<p>The tone and language of this psalm have nothing
special. The situation of the psalmist is the
familiar one of being encompassed by enemies. His
mood is the familiar one of discouragement at the sight
of surrounding perils, which passes through petition into
confidence and triumph. There is nothing in the psalm
inconsistent with the accuracy of the superscription,
which ascribes it to David, when the men of Ziph
would have betrayed him to Saul. Internal evidence
does not suffice to fix its date, if the traditional one
is discarded. But there seems no necessity for regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the singer as the personified nation, though
there is less objection to that theory in this instance
than in some psalms with a more marked individuality
and more fervent expression of personal emotion, to
which it is proposed to apply it.</p>

<p>The structure is simple, like the thought and expression.
The psalm falls into two parts, divided by Selah,&mdash;of
which the former is prayer, spreading before God
the suppliant's straits; and the latter is confident assurance,
blended with petition and vows of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The order in which the psalmist's thoughts run in
the first part (vv. 1-3) is noteworthy. He begins with
appeal to God, and summons before his vision the
characteristics in the Divine nature on which he builds
his hope. Then he pleads for the acceptance of his
prayer, and only when thus heartened does he recount
his perils. That is a deeper faith which begins with
what God is, and thence proceeds to look calmly at
foes, than that which is driven to God in the second
place, as a consequence of an alarmed gaze on
dangers. In the latter case fear strikes out a spark
of faith in the darkness; in the former, faith controls
fear.</p>

<p>The name of God is His manifested nature or
character, the sum of all of Him which has been made
known by His word or work. In that rich manifoldness
of living powers and splendours this man finds
reserves of force, which will avail to save him from any
peril. That name is much more than a collection of
syllables. The expression is beginning to assume the
meaning which it has in post-Biblical Hebrew, where
it is used as a reverential euphemism for the ineffable
Jehovah. Especially to God's power does the singer
look with hopeful petitions, as in ver. 1 <i>b</i>. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
whole name is the agent of his salvation. Nothing
less than the whole fulness of the manifested God
is enough for the necessities of one poor man; and
that prayer is not too bold, nor that estimate of need
presumptuous, which asks for nothing less. Since it
is God's "might" which is appealed to, to judge the
psalmist's cause, the judgment contemplated is clearly
not the Divine estimate of the moral desert of his doings,
or retribution to him for these, but the vindication of
his threatened innocence and deliverance of him from
enemies. The reason for the prayer is likewise alleged
as a plea with God to hear. The psalmist prays
because he is ringed about by foes. God will hear
because He is so surrounded. It is blessed to know
that the same circumstances in our lot which drive us
to God incline God to us.</p>

<p>"Strangers," in ver. 3, would most naturally mean
foreigners, but not necessarily so. The meaning would
naturally pass into that of enemies&mdash;men who, even
though of the psalmist's own blood, behave to him in a
hostile manner. The word, then, does not negative the
tradition in the superscription; though the men of Ziph
belonged to the tribe of Judah, they might still be called
"strangers." The verse recurs in Psalm lxxxvi. 14, with
a variation of reading&mdash;namely, "proud" instead of
"strangers." The same variation is found here in some
MSS. and in the Targum. But probably it has crept in
here in order to bring our psalm into correspondence with
the other, and it is better to retain the existing reading,
which is that of the LXX. and other ancient authorities.
The psalmist has no doubt that to hunt after his life
is a sign of godlessness. The proof that violent men
have not "set God before them" is the fact that they
"seek his soul." That is a remarkable assumption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
resting upon a very sure confidence that he is in such
relation to God that enmity to him is sin. The theory
of a national reference would make such identification
of the singer's cause with God's most intelligible. But
the theory that he is an individual, holding a definite
relation to the Divine purposes and being for some end
a Divine instrument, would make it quite as much so.
And if David, who knew that he was destined to be king,
was the singer, his confidence would be natural. The
history represents that his Divine appointment was
sufficiently known to make hostility to him a manifest
indication of rebellion against God. The unhesitating
fusion of his own cause with God's could scarcely have
been ventured by a psalmist, however vigorous his
faith, if all that he had to go on and desired to express
was a devout soul's confidence that God would protect
him. That may be perfectly and yet it may
not follow that opposition to a man is godlessness.
We cannot regard ourselves as standing in such a
relation; but we may be sure that the name, with all
its glories, is mighty to save us too.</p>

<p>Prayer is, as so often in the Psalter, followed by
immediately deepened assurance of victory. The suppliant
rises from his knees, and points the enemies
round him to his one Helper. In ver. 4 <i>b</i> a literal
rendering would mislead. "The Lord is among the
upholders of my soul" seems to bring God down to
a level on which others stand. The psalmist does not
mean this, but that God gathers up in Himself, and
that supremely, the qualities belonging to the conception
of an upholder. It is, in form, an inclusion of God in a
certain class. It is, in meaning, the assertion that He
is the only true representative of the class. Commentators
quote Jephthah's plaintive words to his daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
as another instance of the idiom: "Alas, my daughter,
... thou art one of them that trouble me"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, my
greatest troubler. That one thought, vivified into new
power by the act of prayer, is the psalmist's all-sufficient
buckler, which he plants between himself and his
enemies, bidding them "behold." Strong in the confidence
that has sprung in his heart anew, he can look
forward in the certainty that his adversaries (lit. <i>those
who lie in wait for me</i>) will find their evil recoiling on
themselves. The reading of the Hebrew text is, <i>Evil
shall return to</i>; that of the Hebrew margin, adopted by
the A.V. and R.V., is, <i>He shall requite evil to</i>. The
meanings are substantially the same, only that the one
makes the automatic action of retribution more prominent,
while the other emphasises God's justice in inflicting
it. The latter reading gives increased force to the
swift transition to prayer in ver. 5 <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>That petition is, like others in similar psalms, proper
to the spiritual level of the Old Testament, and not to
that of the New; and it is far more reverent, as well
as accurate, to recognise fully the distinction than to
try to slur it over. At the same time, it is not to be
forgotten that the same lofty consciousness of the
identity of his cause with God's, which we have already
had to notice, operating here in these wishes for the
enemies' destruction, gives another aspect to them than
that of mere outbursts of private vengeance. That
higher aspect is made prominent by the addition "in
Thy troth." God's faithfulness to His purposes and
promises was concerned in the destruction, because
these were pledged to the psalmist's protection. His
well-being was so intertwined with God's promises that
the Divine faithfulness demanded the sweeping away
of his foes. That is evidently not the language which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
fits our lips. It implies a special relation to God's
plans, and it modifies the character of this apparently
vindictive prayer.</p>

<p>The closing verses of this simple, little psalm touch
very familiar notes. The faith which has prayed has
grown so sure of answer that it already begins to think
of the thank-offerings. This is not like the superstitious
vow, "I will give so-and-so if Jupiter"&mdash;or the
Virgin&mdash;"will hear me." This praying man knows
that he is heard, and is not so much vowing as joyfully
anticipating his glad sacrifice. The same incipient
personification of the name as in ver. 1 is very prominent
in the closing strains. Thank-offerings&mdash;not
merely statutory and obligatory, but brought by free,
uncommanded impulse&mdash;are to be offered to "Thy
name," because that name is good. Ver. 7 probably
should be taken as going even further in the same
direction of personification, for "Thy name" is probably
to be taken as the subject of "hath delivered." The
tenses of the verbs in ver. 7 are perfects. They contemplate
the deliverance as already accomplished.
Faith sees the future as present. This psalmist,
surrounded by strangers seeking his life, can quietly
stretch out a hand of faith, and bring near to himself
the to-morrow when he will look back on scattered
enemies and present, glad sacrifices! That power of
drawing a brighter future into a dark present belongs
not to those who build anticipations on wishes, but
to those who found their forecasts on God's known
purpose and character. <i>The name</i> is a firm foundation
for hope. There is no other.</p>

<p>The closing words express confidence in the enemies'
defeat and destruction, with a tinge of feeling that is
not permissible to Christians. But the supplement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
"my desire," is perhaps rather too strongly expressive
of wish for their ruin. Possibly there needs no supplement
at all, and the expression simply paints the
calm security of the man protected by God, who can
"look upon" impotent hostility without the tremor of
an eyelid, because he knows who is his Helper.</p>

<p>The situation of the psalmist has a general correspondence
with that of David in the period of
Absalom's rebellion, and the identification of the
traitorous friend with Ahithophel is naturally suggested.
But there are considerable difficulties in the way of
taking that view. The psalmist is evidently in the
city, from which he longs to escape; but Ahithophel's
treachery was not known to David till after his flight.
Would a king have described his counsellor, however
trusted, as "a man my equal"? The doubt respecting
the identity of the traitor, however, does not seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
militate against the ordinary view of the date and
occasion of the psalm, if we suppose that it belongs
to the period immediately before the outburst of the
conspiracy, when David was still in Jerusalem, but
seeing the treason growing daily bolder, and already
beginning to contemplate flight. The singularly passive
attitude which he maintained during the years of
Absalom's plotting was due to his consciousness of guilt
and his submission to punishment. Hitzig ascribes
the psalm to Jeremiah, principally on the ground of the
resemblance of the prophet's wish for a lodge in the
wilderness (Jer. ix. 2) to the psalmist's yearning in
vv. 6-8. Cheyne brings it down to the Persian period;
Olshausen, to the Maccabean. The Davidic authorship
has at least as much to say for itself as any of these
conjectures.</p>

<p>The psalm may be regarded as divided into three
parts, in each of which a different phase of agitated
feeling predominates, but not exclusively. Strong
excitement does not marshal emotions or their expression
according to artistic proprieties of sequence, and
this psalm is all ablaze with it. That vehemence of
emotion sufficiently accounts for both the occasional
obscurities and the manifest want of strict accuracy in
the flow of thought, without the assumption of dislocation
of parts or piecing it with a fragment of
another psalm. When the heart is writhing within,
and tumultuous feelings are knocking at the door of
the lips, the words will be troubled and heaped together,
and dominant thoughts will repeat themselves in
defiance of logical continuity. But, still, complaint and
longing sound through the waning, yearning notes of
vv. 1-8; hot indignation and terrible imprecations in
the stormy central portion (vv. 9-15); and a calmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
note of confidence and hope, through which, however,
the former indignation surges up again, is audible in
the closing verses (vv. 16-23).</p>

<p>The psalmist pictures his emotions in the first part,
with but one reference to their cause, and but one
verse of petition. He begins, indeed, with asking
that his prayer may be heard; and it is well when a
troubled heart can raise itself above the sea of troubles
to stretch a hand towards God. Such an effort of
faith already prophesies firm footing on the safe shore.
But very pathetic and true to the experience of many
a sorrowing heart is the psalmist's immediately subsequent
dilating on his griefs. There is a dumb sorrow,
and there is one which unpacks its heart in many
words and knows not when to stop. The psalmist is
<i>distracted</i> in his bitter brooding on his troubles. The
word means to move restlessly, and may either apply
to body or mind, perhaps to both; for Eastern demonstrativeness
is not paralysed, but stimulated to bodily
tokens, by sorrow. He can do nothing but groan or
moan. His heart "writhes" in him. Like an avalanche,
deadly terrors have fallen on him and crushed him.
Fear and trembling have pierced into his inner being,
and "horror" (a rare word, which the LXX. here
renders <i>darkness</i>) wraps him round or covers him,
as a cloak does. It is not so much the pressure of
present evil, as the shuddering anticipation of a heavier
storm about to burst, which is indicated by these
pathetic expressions. The cause of them is stated in
a single verse (3). "The voice of the enemy" rather
than his hand is mentioned first, since threats and
reproaches precede assaults; and it is budding, not full-blown,
enmity which is in view. In ver. 3 <i>b</i> "oppression"
is an imperfect parallelism with "voice," and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
conjectural emendation (which only requires the prefixing
of a letter) of "cries," adopted by Cheyne, after
Olshausen and others, is tempting. They "fling down
iniquity" on him as rocks are hurled or rolled from
a height on invaders&mdash;a phrase which recalls David's
words to his servants, urging flight before Absalom,
"lest he bring down evil upon us."</p>

<p>Then, from out of all this plaintive description of the
psalmist's agitation and its causes, starts up that immortal
strain which answers to the deepest longings of the
soul, and has touched responsive chords in all whose
lives are not hopelessly outward and superficial&mdash;the
yearning for repose. It may be ignoble, or lofty and
pure; it may mean only cowardice or indolence; but
it is deepest in those who stand most unflinchingly at
their posts, and crush it down at the command of duty.
Unless a soul knows that yearning for a home in stillness,
"afar from the sphere of our sorrow," it will
remain a stranger to many high and noble things.
The psalmist was moved to utter this longing by his
painful consciousness of encompassing evils; but the
longing is more than a desire for exemption from these.
It is the cry of the homeless soul, which, like the dove
from the ark, finds no resting-place in a world full of
carrion, and would fain return whence it came. "O
God, Thou hast made us for Thyself, and we are
unquiet till we find rest in Thee." No obligation of
duty keeps migratory birds in a land where winter is
near. But men are better than birds, because they
have other things to think of than repose, and must
face, not flee, storms and hurricanes. It is better to
have wings "like birds of tempest-loving kind," and to
beat up against the wind, than to outfly it in retreat.
So the psalmist's wish was but a wish; and he, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
rest of us, had to stand to his post, or be tied to his
stake, and let enemies and storms do their worst. The
LXX. has a striking reading of ver. 8, which Cheyne
has partially adopted. It reads for ver. 8 <i>a</i> "waiting for
Him who saves me"; but beautiful as this is, as giving
the picture of the restful fugitive in patient expectation,
it brings an entirely new idea into the picture, and
blends metaphor and fact confusedly. The Selah at
the close of ver. 7 deepens the sense of still repose by
a prolonged instrumental interlude.</p>

<p>The second part turns from subjective feelings to
objective facts. A cry for help and a yearning for a
safe solitude were natural results of the former; but
when the psalmist's eye turns to his enemies, a flash
of anger lights it, and, instead of the meek longings
of the earlier verses, prayers for their destruction
are vehemently poured out. The state of things in the
city corresponds to what must have been the condition
of Jerusalem during the incubation of Absalom's conspiracy,
but is sufficiently general to fit any time of
strained party feeling. The caldron simmers, ready to
boil over. The familiar evils, of which so many psalms
complain, are in full vigour. The psalmist enumerates
them with a wealth of words which indicates their
abundance. Violence, strife, iniquity, mischief, oppression,
and deceit&mdash;a goodly company to patrol the streets
and fill the open places of the city! Ver. 10 <i>a</i> is
sometimes taken as carrying on the personification
of Violence and Strife in ver. 9, by painting these as
going their rounds on the walls, like sentries; but it is
better to suppose that the actual foes are meant, and
that they are keeping up a strict watch to prevent the
psalmist's escape.</p>

<p>Several commentators consider that the burst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
indignation against the psalmist's traitorous friend in
vv. 12-14 interrupts the sequence, and propose rearrangements
by which vv. 20, 21, will be united with
vv. 12-14, and placed either before ver. 6 or after
ver. 15. But the very abruptness with which the thought
of the traitor is interjected here, and in the subsequent
reference to him, indicates how the singer's heart was
oppressed by the treason; and the return to the subject
in ver. 20 is equally significant of his absorbed and
pained brooding on the bitter fact. That is a slight
pain which is removed by one cry. Rooted griefs, overwhelming
sorrows, demand many repetitions. Trouble
finds ease in tautology. It is absurd to look for cool,
logical sequence in such a heart's cry as this psalm.
Smooth continuity would be most unnatural. The
psalmist feels that the defection of his false friend is
the worst blow of all. He could have braced himself
to bear an enemy's reviling; he could have found
weapons to repel, or a shelter in which to escape from,
open foes; but the baseness which forgets all former
sweet companionship in secret, and all association in
public and in worship, is more than he can bear up
against. The voice of wounded love is too plain in the
words for the hypothesis that the singer is the personified
nation. Traitors are too common to allow of
a very confident affirmation that the psalm must point to
Ahithophel, and the description of the perfidious friend
as the <i>equal</i> of the psalmist does not quite fit that
case.</p>

<p>As he thinks of all the sweetness of past intimacy,
turned to gall by such dastardly treachery, his anger
rises. The description of the city and of the one
enemy in whom all its wickedness is, as it were,
concentrated, is framed in a terrible circlet of prayers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
for the destruction of the foes. Ver. 9 <i>a</i> begins and
ver. 15 ends this part with petitions which do not
breathe the spirit of "Father, forgive them." There
may be a reference to the confusion of tongues at Babel
in the prayer of ver. 9. As then the impious work
was stopped by mutual unintelligibility, so the psalmist
desires that his enemies' machinations may be paralysed
in like manner. In ver. 15 the translation "desolations"
follows the Hebrew text, while the alternative and in
some respects preferable reading "May death come suddenly"
follows the Hebrew marginal correction. There
are difficulties in both, and the correction does not
so much smooth the language as to be obviously an
improvement. The general sense is clear, whichever
reading is preferred. The psalmist is calling down
destruction on his enemies; and while the fact that he
is in some manner an organ of the Divine purpose
invests hostility to him with the darker character of
rebellion against God, and therefore modifies the
personal element in the prayer, it still remains a plain
instance of the lower level on which the Old Testament
saints and singers stood, when compared with the
"least in the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>The third part of the psalm returns to gentler tones
of devotion and trust. The great name of Jehovah
appears here significantly. To that ever-living One,
the Covenant God, will the psalmist cry, in assurance
of answer. "Evening, and morning, and noon" designate
the whole day by its three principal divisions, and
mean, in effect, continually. Happy are they who are
impelled to unintermitting prayer by the sight of unslumbering
enmity! Enemies may go their rounds
"day and night," but they will do little harm, if the
poor, hunted man, whom they watch so closely, lifts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
his cries to Heaven "evening, and morning, and noon."
The psalmist goes back to his first words. He had
begun by saying that he was distracted as he mused,
and could do nothing but groan, and in ver. 17 he
repeats that he will still do so. Has he, then, won
nothing by his prayer but the prolongation of his first
dreary tone of feeling? He has won this&mdash;that his
musing is not accompanied by distraction, and that
his groaning is not involuntary expression of pain,
but articulate prayer, and therefore accompanied by the
confidence of being heard. Communion with God and
prayerful trust in his help do not at once end sadness
and sobbing, but do change their character and lighten
the blackness of grief. This psalmist, like so many of
his fellows, realises deliverance before he experiences
it, and can sing "He has redeemed my soul" even
while the calamity lasts. "They come not near me,"
says he. A soul hidden in God has an invisible defence
which repels assaults. As with a man in a diving-bell,
the sea may press on the crystal walls, but cannot crush
them in or enter, and there is safe, dry lodging inside,
while sea billows and monsters are without, close to
the diver and yet far from him.</p>

<p>Ver. 19 is full of difficulty, and most probably has
suffered some textual corruption. To "hear and
answer" is uniformly an expression for gracious hearing
and beneficent answering. Here it can only mean the
opposite, or must be used ironically. God will hear
the enemies' threats, and will requite them. Various
expedients have been suggested for removing the
difficulty. It has been proposed to read "me" for
"them," which would bring everything into order&mdash;only
that, then, the last clauses of the verse, which begin
with a relative ("who have no changes," etc.), would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
want an antecedent. It has been proposed to read
"will humble them" for "will answer them," which
is the LXX. translation. That requires a change
in the vowels of the verb, and "answer" is more
probable than "humble" after "hear." Cheyne
follows Olshausen in supposing that "the cry of the
afflicted" has dropped out after "hear." The construction
of ver. 19 <i>b</i> is anomalous, as the clause
is introduced by a superfluous "and," which may
be a copyist's error. The Selah attached is no less
anomalous. It is especially difficult to explain, in
view of the relative which begins the third clause,
and which would otherwise be naturally brought into
close connection with the "them," the objects of the
verbs in <i>a</i>. These considerations lead Hupfeld to
regard ver. 19 as properly ending with Selah, and
the remaining clauses as out of place, and properly
belonging to ver. 15 or 18; while Cheyne regards
the alternative supposition that they are a fragment of
another psalm as possible. There is probably some
considerable corruption of the text, not now to be
remedied; but the existing reading is at least capable
of explanation and defence. The principal difficulty in
the latter part of ver. 19 is the meaning of the word
rendered "changes." The persons spoken of are those
whom God will hear and answer in His judicial character,
in which He has been throned from of old.
Their not having "changes" is closely connected with
their not fearing God. The word is elsewhere used
for changes of raiment, or for the relief of military
guards. Calvin and others take the changes intended
to be vicissitudes of fortune, and hence draw the true
thought that unbroken prosperity tends to forgetfulness
of God. Others take the changes to be those of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
or conduct from evil to good, while others fall back
upon the metaphor of relieving guard, which they connect
with the picture in ver. 10 of the patrols on the
walls, so getting the meaning "they have no cessation
in their wicked watchfulness." It must be acknowledged
that none of these meanings is quite satisfactory;
but probably the first, which expresses the familiar
thought of the godlessness attendant on uninterrupted
prosperity, is best.</p>

<p>Then follows another reference to the traitorous
friend, which, by its very abruptness, declares how
deep is the wound he has inflicted. The psalmist does
not stand alone. He classes with himself those who
remained faithful to him. The traitor has not yet
thrown off his mask, though the psalmist has penetrated
his still retained disguise. He comes with smooth
words; but, in the vigorous language of ver. 21, "his
heart is war." The fawning softness of words known
to be false cuts into the heart, which had trusted
and knows itself betrayed, more sharply than keen
steel.</p>

<p>Ver. 22 has been singularly taken as the smooth
words which cut so deep; but surely that is a very
strained interpretation. Much rather does the psalmist
exhort himself and all who have the same bitterness
to taste, to commit themselves to Jehovah. What is
it which he exhorts us to cast on Him? The word
employed is used here only, and its meaning is therefore
questionable. The LXX. and others translate "care."
Others, relying on Talmudic usage, prefer "burden,"
which is appropriate to the following promise of being
held erect. Others (Hupfeld, etc.) would read "that
which He has given thee." The general sense is clear,
and the faith expressed in both exhortation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
appended promise has been won by the singer through
his prayer. He is counselling and encouraging himself.
The spirit has to spur the "soul" to heroisms of faith
and patience. He is declaring a universal truth. However
crushing our loads of duty or of sorrow, we
receive strength to carry them with straight backs,
if we cast them on Jehovah. The promise is not that
He will take away the pressure, but that He will hold
us up under it; and, similarly, the last clause declares
that the righteous will not be allowed to stumble.
Faith is mentioned before righteousness. The two
must go together; for trust which is not accompanied
and manifested by righteousness is no true trust, and
righteousness which is not grounded in trust is no
stable or real righteousness.</p>

<p>The last verse sums up the diverse fates of the
"men of blood and deceit" and of the psalmist. The
terrible prayers of the middle portion of the psalm
have wrought the assurance of their fulfilment, just
as the cries of faith have brought the certainty of
theirs. So the two closing verses of the psalm turn
both parts of the earlier petitions into prophecies; and
over against the trustful, righteous psalmist, standing
erect and unmoved, there is set the picture of the
"man of blood and deceit," chased down the black
slopes to the depths of destruction by the same God
whose hand holds up the man that trusts in Him.
It is a dreadful contrast, and the spirit of the whole
psalm is gathered into it. The last clause of all makes
"I" emphatic. It expresses the final resolution which
springs in the singer's heart in view of that dread

<p>The superscription dates this psalm from the time
of David's being in Gath. Probably his first stay
there is meant, during which he had recourse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
feigned insanity in order to secure his safety. What a
contrast between the seeming idiot scrabbling on the
walls and the saintly singer of this lovely song of
purest trust! But striking as the contrast is, it is not
too violent to be possible. Such heroic faith might lie
very near such employment of pardonable dissimulation,
even if the two moods of feeling can scarcely
have been contemporaneous. Swift transitions characterise
the poetic temperament; and, alas! fluctuations
of courage and faith characterise the devout soul.
Nothing in the psalm specially suggests the date
assigned in the superscription; but, as we have already
had occasion to remark, that may be an argument for,
not against, the correctness of the superscription.</p>

<p>The psalm is simple in structure. Like others
ascribed to David during the Sauline period, it has a
refrain, which divides it into two parts; but these are
of substantially the same purport, with the difference
that the second part enlarges the description of the
enemies' assaults, and rises to confident anticipation of
their defeat. In that confidence the singer adds a
closing expression of thankfulness for the deliverance
already realised in faith.</p>

<p>The first part begins with that significant contrast
which is the basis of all peaceful fronting of a hostile
world or any evil. On one side stands man, whose
very name here suggests feebleness, and on the other
is God. "Man" in ver. 1 is plainly a collective. The
psalmist masses the foes, whom he afterwards individualises
and knows only too well to be a multitude,
under that generic appellation, which brings out their
inherent frailty. Be they ever so many, still they all
belong to the same class, and an infinite number of
nothings only sums up into nothing. The Divine Unit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
is more than all these. The enemy is said to "pant
after" the psalmist, as a wild beast open-mouthed and
ready to devour; or, according to others, the word
means to <i>crush</i>. The thing meant by the strong
metaphor is given in ver. 1 <i>b</i>. 2; namely, the continual
hostile activity of the foe. The word rendered
"proudly" is literally "on high," and Baethgen
suggests that the literal meaning should be retained.
He supposes that the antagonists "held an influential
position in a princely court." Even more literally the
word may describe the enemies as occupying a post of
vantage, from which they shower down missiles.</p>

<p>One brief verse, the brevity of which gives it emphasis,
tells of the singer's fears, and of how he
silences them by the dead lift of effort by which he
constrains himself to trust. It is a strangely shallow
view which finds a contradiction in this utterance,
which all hearts, that have ever won calmness in agitation
and security amid encompassing dangers by the
same means, know to correspond to their own experience.
If there is no fear, there is little trust. The two
do co-exist. The eye that takes in only visible facts
on the earthly level supplies the heart with abundant
reasons for fear. But it rests with ourselves whether
we shall yield to those, or whether, by lifting our eyes
higher and fixing the vision on the Unseen and on
Him who is invisible, we shall call such an ally to our
side as shall make fear and doubt impossible. We
have little power of directly controlling fear or any
other feeling, but we can determine the objects on
which we shall fix attention. If we choose to look at
"man," we shall be unreasonable if we do not fear; if
we choose to look at God, we shall be more unreasonable
if we do not trust. The one antagonist of fear is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
faith. Trust is a voluntary action for which we are
responsible.</p>

<p>The frequent use of the phrase "In the day when"
is noticeable. It occurs in each verse of the first part,
excepting the refrain. The antagonists are continually
at work, and the psalmist, on his part, strives to meet
their machinations and to subdue his own fears with
as continuous a faith. The phrase recurs in the second
part in a similar connection. Thus, then, the situation
as set forth in the first part has three elements,&mdash;the
busy malice of the foes; the effort of the psalmist, his
only weapon against them, to hold fast his confidence;
and the power and majesty of God, who will be
gracious when besought. The refrain gathers up
these three in a significantly different order. The
preceding verses arranged them thus&mdash;God, man, the
trusting singer. The refrain puts them thus&mdash;God,
the trusting singer, man. When the close union
between a soul and God is clearly seen and inwardly
felt, the importance of the enemies dwindles. When
faith is in the act of springing up, God, the refuge, and
man, the source of apprehension, stand over against
each other, and the suppliant, looking on both, draws
near to God. But when faith has fruited, the believing
soul is coupled so closely to the Divine Object of its
faith, that He and it are contemplated as joined in
blessed reciprocity of protection and trust, and enemies
are in an outer region, where they cannot disturb its
intercourse with its God. The order of thought in
the refrain is also striking. First, the singer praises
God's word. By God's gracious help he knows that
he will receive the fulfilment of God's promises (not
necessarily any special "word," such as the promise
of a throne to David). And then, on the experience of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
God's faithfulness thus won, is reared a further structure
of trust, which completely subdues fear. This is the
reward of the effort after faith which the psalmist
made. He who begins with determining not to fear
will get such tokens of God's troth that fear will melt
away like a cloud, and he will find his sky cleared,
as the nightly heavens are swept free of cloud-rack by
the meek moonlight.</p>

<p>The second part covers the same ground. Trust,
like love, never finds it grievous to write the same
things. There is delight, and there is strengthening
for the temper of faith, in repeating the contemplation
of the earthly facts which make it necessary, and the
super-sensuous facts which make it blessed. A certain
expansion of the various parts of the theme, as compared
with the first portion of the psalm, is obvious.
Again the phrase "all the day" occurs in reference
to the unwearying hostility which dogs the singer.
"They wrest my words" may be, as Cheyne prefers,
"They torture me with words." That rendering would
supply a standing feature of the class of psalms to
which this belongs. The furtive assembling, the
stealthy setting of spies who watch his steps (lit.
<i>heels</i>, as ready to spring on him from behind), are no
new things, but are in accordance with what has long
been the enemies' practice.</p>

<p>Ver. 7 brings in a new element not found in the
first part&mdash;namely, the prayer for the destruction of
these unwearied watchers. Its first clause is obscure.
If the present text is adhered to, the rendering of
the clause as a question is best. A suggested textual
correction has been largely adopted by recent commentators,
which by a very slight alteration gives the
meaning "For their iniquity requite them." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
alteration, however, is not necessary, and the existing
text may be retained, though the phrase is singular.
The introduction of a prayer for a world-wide judgment
in the midst of so intensely individual a psalm
is remarkable, and favours the theory that the afflicted
man of the psalm is really the nation; but it may be
explained on the ground that, as in Psalm vii. 8, the
judgment on behalf of one man is contemplated as
only one smaller manifestation of the same judicial
activity which brings about the universal judgment.
This single reference to the theme which fills so considerable
a part of the other psalms of this class is in
harmony with the whole tone of this gem of quiet
faith, which is too much occupied with the blessedness
of its own trust to have many thoughts of the end
of others. It passes, therefore, quickly, to dwell on
yet another phase of that blessedness.</p>

<p>The tender words of ver. 8 need little elucidation.
They have brought comfort to many, and have helped
to dry many tears. How the psalmist presses close
to God, and how sure he is of His gentle care and
love! "Thou reckonest my wandering." The thought
is remarkable, both in its realisation of God's individualising
relation to the soul that trusts Him, and
as in some degree favouring the Davidic authorship.
The hunted fugitive feels that every step of his
weary interlacing tracks, as he stole from point to
point as danger dictated, was known to God. The
second clause of the verse is thought by prosaic commentators
to interrupt the sequence, because it interjects
a petition between two statements; but surely
nothing is more natural than such an "interruption."
What a lovely figure is that of God's treasuring up
His servants' tears in His "bottle," the skin in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
liquids were kept! What does He keep them for?
To show how precious they are in His sight, and
perhaps to suggest that they are preserved for a
future use. The tears that His children shed and
give to Him to keep cannot be tears of rebellious or
unmeasured weeping, and will be given back one day
to those who shed them, converted into refreshment,
by the same Power which of old turned water into
wine.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Think not thou canst weep a tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And thy Maker is not near."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not only in order to minister retribution to those who
inflicted them, but also in order to give recompense
of gladness to weepers, are these tears preserved by
God; and the same idea is repeated by the other
metaphor of ver. 8 <i>c</i>. God's book, or reckoning, contains
the count of all the tears as well as wanderings
of His servant. The certainty that it is so is expressed
by the interrogative form of the clause.</p>

<p>The "then" of ver. 9 may be either temporal or
logical. It may mean "things being so," or "in
consequence of this," or it may mean "at the time
when," and may refer to the further specification of
period in the next clause. That same day which
has already been designated as that of the enemies'
panting after the psalmist's life, and wresting of his
words, and, on the other hand, as that of his fear,
is now the time of his prayer, and consequently
of their defeat and flight. The confidence which
struggled with fear in the closing words of the first
part, is now consolidated into certain knowledge that
God is on the singer's side, and in a very deep sense
belongs to him. This is the foundation of his hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
of deliverance; and in this clear knowledge he chants
once more his refrain. As is often the case, slight
differences, mainly due to artistic love of variety in
uniformity, occur in the repeated refrain. "Word"
stands instead of "His word"; "man," instead of
"flesh"; and a line is intercalated, in which Jehovah
is substituted for God. The addition may be a later
interpolation, but is probably part of the original text,
and due to the same intelligible motives which
prompted the occasional use of the great Covenant
Name in the Elohistic psalms of this second book.</p>

<p>The psalmist's exuberant confidence overflows the
limits of his song, in a closing couple of verses which
are outside its scheme. So sure is he of deliverance,
that, as often in similar psalms, his thoughts are
busied in preparing his sacrifice of thanks before the
actual advent of the mercy for which it is to be offered.
Such swift-footed Gratitude is the daughter of very
vivid Faith. The ground of the thankoffering is deliverance
of "the soul," for which foes have "waited."
"Thou hast delivered" is a perfect tense expressing
confidence in the certainty of the as yet unrealised
exercise of God's power. The question of ver. 13 <i>b</i>, like
that of ver. 8 <i>c</i> (and perhaps that of ver. 7 <i>a</i>), is an
emphatic affirmation, and the verb to be supplied is not
"Wilt thou?" as the A.V. has it, but, as is plain from
the context, and from the quotation of this verse in
Psalm cxvi. 8, "Hast thou?" The Divine deliverance
is complete,&mdash;not only doing the greater, but also the
less; and not barely saving life, but sustaining the steps.
God does not rescue by halves, either in the natural or
spiritual realm; but in the former He first rescues and
next preserves, and in the latter He delivers from the
true death of the spirit, and then inspires to glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
obedience. The psalm crowns its celebration of God's
miracles of deliverance by declaring the aim of them
all to be that their recipient may walk before God&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
in continual consciousness of His cognisance of his
deeds, and "in the light of the living" or "of life."
The expression seems here to mean simply the present
life, as contrasted with the darkness and inactivity of
Sheol; but we can scarcely help remembering the
deeper meaning given to it by Him who said that to
follow Him was to have the light of life. Whether
any dim foreboding of a better light than streams from
even an Eastern sun, and of a truer life than the vain
shadow which men call by that august name, floated
before the singer or not, we can thankfully interpret
his words, so as to make them the utterance of the
Christian consciousness that the ultimate design of all
God's deliverances of souls from death and of feet
from falling is that, not only in ways of holiness here,
but in the more perfect consciousness of His greater
nearness hereafter, and in correspondingly increased
perfectness of active service, we should walk before
God in the light of the living.</p>

<p>This psalm resembles the preceding in the singer's
circumstances of peril and in his bold faith. It
has also points of contact in the cry, "Be gracious,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and in the remarkable expression for enemies, "Those
that would swallow me up." It has also several
features in common with the other psalms ascribed by
the superscriptions to the time of the Sauline persecution.
Like Psalm vii. are the metaphor of <i>lions</i> for
enemies, that of <i>digging a pit</i> for their plots, the use
of <i>glory</i> as a synonym for soul. The difficult word
rendered "destructions" in ver. 1 connects this psalm
with Psalm lv. 11, dated as belonging to the time of
Saul's hostility, and with Psalms v. 9 and xxxviii. 12,
both traditionally Davidic. There is nothing in the
psalm against the attribution of it to David in the cave,
whether of Adullam or Engedi, and the allusions to
lying down among lions may possibly have been suggested
by the wild beasts prowling round the psalmist's
shelter. The use in ver. 1 of the picturesque word
for taking refuge derives special appropriateness from
the circumstances of the fugitive, over whose else
defenceless head the sides of his cave arched themselves
like great wings, beneath which he lay safe,
though the growls of beasts of prey echoed round.
But there is no need to seek for further certainty as to
the occasion of the psalm. Baethgen thinks that it can
only have been composed after "the annihilation of
the independence of the Israelite state," because the
vow in ver. 9 to make God's name known among the
nations can only be the utterance of the oppressed
congregation, which is sure of deliverance, because it is
conscious of its Divine call to sing God's praise to
heathens. But that vow is equally explicable on the
assumption that the individual singer was conscious of
such a call.</p>

<p>There is no very sharp division of parts in the psalm.
A grand refrain separates it into two portions, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
former of which prayer for deliverance and contemplation
of dangers prevail, while in the latter the foe
is beheld as already baffled, and exuberant praise is
poured forth and vowed.</p>

<p>As in Psalm liv. and often, the first part begins with
an act of faith reaching out to God, and strengthening
itself by the contemplation of His character and acts.
That energy of confidence wins assurance of help, and
only after that calming certitude has filled the soul
does the psalmist turn his eye directly on his enemies.
His faith does not make him oblivious of his danger,
but it minimises his dread. An eye that has seen God
sees little terror in the most terrible things.</p>

<p>The psalmist knows that a soul which trusts has a
right to God's gracious dealings, and he is not afraid to
urge his confidence as a plea with God. The boldness
of the plea is not less indicative of the depth and purity
of his religious experience than are the tender metaphors
in which it is expressed. What truer or richer
description of trust could be given than that which
likens it to the act of a fugitive betaking himself to
the shelter of some mountain fastness, impregnable and
inaccessible? What lovelier thought of the safe, warm
hiding-place which God affords was ever spoken than
that of "the shadow of Thy wings"? Very significant
is the recurrence of the same verb in two different
tenses in two successive clauses (1 <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>). The psalmist
heartens himself for present and future trust by
remembrance of past days, when he exercised it and
was not put to shame. That faith is blessed, and cannot
but be strong, which is nurtured by the remembrance
of past acts of rewarded faith, as the leaves of bygone
summers make rich mould for a new generation of
flowers. When kites are in the sky, young birds seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
protection from the mother's wing as well as warmth
from her breast. So the singer betakes himself to his
shelter till "destructions are gone by." Possibly these
are likened to a wild storm which sweeps across the
land, but is not felt in the stillness of the cave fortress.
Hidden in God, a man "heareth not the loud winds
when they call," and may solace himself in the midst of
their roar by the thought that they will soon blow over.
He will not cease to take refuge in God when the stress
is past, nor throw off his cloak when the rain ceases;
but he will nestle close while it lasts, and have as his
reward the clear certainty of its transiency. The faith
which clings to God after the tempest is no less close
than that which screened itself in Him while it raged.</p>

<p>Hidden in his shelter, the psalmist, in ver. 2, tells
himself the grounds on which he may be sure that his
cry to God will not be in vain. His name is "Most
High," and His elevation is the pledge of His irresistible
might. He is the "God" (the Strong) who accomplishes
all for the psalmist which he needs, and His
past manifestations in that character make His future
interventions certain. Therefore the singer is sure of
what will happen. Two bright angels&mdash;Loving-kindness
and Troth or Faithfulness their names&mdash;will be
despatched from heaven for the rescue of the man who
has trusted. That is certain, because of what God is
and has done. It is no less certain, because of what
the psalmist is and has done; for a soul that gazes on
God as its sole Helper, and has pressed, in its feebleness,
close beneath these mighty pinions, cannot but
bring down angel helpers, the executants of God's love.</p>

<p>The confidence expressed in ver. 2 is interrupted
by an abrupt glance at the enemy. "He that would
swallow me up blasphemes" is the most probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
rendering of a difficult phrase, the meaning and connection
of which are both dubious. If it is so rendered,
the connection is probably that which we have expressed
in the translation by inserting "For." The
wish to destroy the psalmist is itself blasphemy, or is
accompanied with blasphemy; and therefore God will
surely send down what will bring it to nought. The
same identification of his own cause with God's, which
marks many of the psalms ascribed to the persecuted
David, underlies this sudden reference to the enemy,
and warrants the conclusion drawn, that help will come.
The Selah at the end of the clause is unusual in the
middle of a verse; but it may be intended to underscore,
as it were, the impiety of the enemy, and so corresponds
with the other Selah in ver. 6, which is also in an unusual
place, and points attention to the enemy's ruin,
as this does to his wickedness.</p>

<p>The description of the psalmist's circumstances in
ver. 4 presents considerable difficulty. The division
of clauses, the force of the form of the verb rendered
<i>I must lie down</i>, and the meaning and construction of
the word rendered "those who breathe out fire," are all
questionable. If the accents are adhered to, the first
clause of the verse is "My soul is among lions." That is
by some&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Delitzsch&mdash;regarded as literal description
of the psalmist's environment, but it is more natural to
suppose that he is applying a familiar metaphor to his
enemies. In v. 4 <i>b</i> the verb rendered above "I must
lie down" is in a form which has usually a cohortative or
optative force, and is by some supposed to have that
meaning here, and to express trust which is willing to
lie down even in a lion's den. It seems, however, here
to denote objective necessity rather than subjective
willingness. Hupfeld would read <i>lies down</i> (third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
person), thus making "My soul" the subject of the
verb, and getting rid of the difficult optative form.
Cheyne suggests a further slight alteration in the word,
so as to read, "My soul hath dwelt"&mdash;a phrase found
in Psalm cxx. 6; and this emendation is tempting. The
word rendered "those who breathe out fire" is by some
taken to mean "those who devour," and is variously
construed, as referring to the <i>lions</i> in <i>a</i>, taken literally,
or as describing the <i>sons of men</i> in <i>c</i>. The general
drift of the verse is clear. The psalmist is surrounded
by enemies, whom he compares, as the Davidic psalms
habitually do, to wild beasts. They are ready to rend.
Open-mouthed they seem to breathe out flames, and
their slanders cut like swords.</p>

<p>The psalmist's contemplation of his forlorn lair among
men worse than beasts of prey drives him back to
realise again his refuge in God. He, as it were,
wrenches his mind round to look at God rather than at
the enemies. Clear perception of peril and weakness
does its best work, when it drives to as clear recognition
of God's help, and wings faithful prayer. The psalmist,
in his noble refrain, has passed beyond the purely
personal aspect of the desired deliverance, and wishes
not only that he may be shielded from his foes, but
that God would, in that deliverance, manifest Himself
in His elevation above and power over all created
things. To conceive of his experience as thus contributing
to God's world-wide glory seems presumptuous;
but even apart from the consideration that the psalmist
was conscious of a world-wide mission, the lowliest
suppliant has a right to feel that his deliverance will
enhance the lustre of that Glory; and the lowlier he
feels himself, the more wonderful is its manifestations
in his well-being. But if there is a strange note in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
apparent audacity of this identification, there is a deep
one of self-suppression in the fading from the psalmist's
prayer of all mention of himself, and the exclusive contemplation
of the effects on the manifestation of God's
character, which may follow his deliverance. It is a
rare and lofty attainment to regard one's own well-being
mainly in its connection with God's "glory," and to
desire the latter more consciously and deeply than the
former.</p>

<p>It has been proposed by Hupfeld to transpose vv. 5, 6,
on the ground that a recurrence to the description of
dangers is out of place after the refrain, and incongruous
with the tone of the second part of the psalm.
But do the psalmists observe such accuracy in the flow
of their emotions? and is it not natural for a highly
emotional lyric like this to allow some surge of feeling
to run over its barriers? The reference to the enemies
in ver. 6 is of a triumphant sort, which naturally prepares
for the burst of praise following, and worthily
follows even the lyrical elevation of the refrain. The
perfects seem at first sight to refer to past deliverances,
which the psalmist recalls in order to assure himself of
future ones. But this retrospective reference is not
necessary, and the whole description in ver. 6 is rather
to be taken as that of approaching retribution on the
foes, which is so certain to come that the singer celebrates
it as already as good as done. The familiar
figures of the net and pit, by both of which wild animals
are caught, and the as familiar picture of the hunter
trapped in his own pitfall, need no elucidation. There is
a grim irony of events, which often seems to delight in
showing "the engineer hoised with his own petard";
and whether that spectacle is forthcoming or not, the
automatic effects of wrongdoing always follow, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
man digs pits for others but somehow and somewhen he
finds himself at the bottom of them, and his net wrapped
round his own limbs. The Selah at the end of ver. 6
calls spectators to gather, as it were, round the sight
of the ensnared plotter, lying helpless down there. A
slight correction of the text does away with a difficulty
in ver. 6 <i>b</i>. The verb there is transitive, and in the
existing text is in the singular, but "He has bowed
down my soul" would be awkward, though not impossible,
when coming between two clauses in which the
enemies are spoken of in the plural. The emendation
of the verb to the third person plural by the addition
of a letter brings the clauses into line, and retains the
usual force of the verb.</p>

<p>The psalmist has done with the enemies; they are
at the bottom of the pit. In full confidence of triumph
and deliverance, he breaks out into a grand burst of
praise. "My heart is fixed," or "steadfast." Twice
the psalmist repeats this, as he does other emphatic
thoughts, in this psalm (<i>cp.</i> vv. 2, 4, 8, 9). What
power can steady that fluttering, wayward, agitated
thing, a human heart? The way to keep light articles
fixed on deck, amidst rolling seas and howling winds, is
to lash them to something fixed; and the way to steady
a heart is to bind it to God. Built into the Rock, the
building partakes of the steadfastness of its foundation.
Knit to God, a heart is firm. The psalmist's was steadfast
because it had taken refuge in God; and so, even
before his rescue from his enemies came to pass, he
was emancipated from the fear of them, and could lift
this song of praise. He had said that he must lie down
among lions. But wherever his bed may be, he is sure
that he will rise from it; and however dark the night,
he is sure that a morning will come. In a bold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
beautiful figure he says that he will "wake the dawn"
with his song.</p>

<p>The world-wide destination of his praise is clear to
him. It is plain that such anticipations as those of
ver. 9 surpass the ordinary poetic consciousness, and
must be accounted for on some special ground. The
favourite explanation at present is that the singer is
Israel, conscious of its mission. The old explanation
that the singer is a king, conscious of his inspiration
and divinely given office, equally meets the case.</p>

<p>The psalmist had declared his trust that God would
send out His angels of Loving-kindness and Troth. He
ends his song with the conviction, which has become
to him matter of experience, that these Divine "attributes"
tower to heaven, and in their height symbolise
their own infinitude. Nor is the other truth suggested
by ver. 10 to be passed over, that the manifestation of
these attributes on earth leads to their being more
gloriously visible in heaven. These two angels, who
come forth from on high to do God's errands for His
poor, trusting servant, go back, their work done, and
are hailed as victors by the celestial inhabitants. By
God's manifestation of these attributes to a man, His
glory is exalted above the heavens and all the earth.
The same thought is more definitely expressed in Paul's
declaration that "to the principalities and powers in
heavenly places is known by the Church the manifold
wisdom of God."</p>

</p>


<p>This psalmist's fiery indignation against unjust
judges and evil-doers generally is not kindled by
personal wrongs. The psalm comes hot from a heart
lacerated by the sight of widespread corruption, and constrained
to seek for patience in the thought of the swift
sweeping away of evil men before their plans are effected.
Stern triumph in the punitive manifestations of God's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
rule, and keen sense of the need of such, are its keynotes.
Vehement emotion stirs the poet's imagination
to heap together strong and, in part, obscure metaphors.
Here emphatically "Indignatio facit versus." The
psalm is Dantesque in its wealth of sombre imagination,
which produces the most solemn effects with the
homeliest metaphors, and in its awed and yet satisfied
contemplation of the fate of evil-doers. It parts itself
into three portions,&mdash;a dark picture of abounding evil
(vv. 1-5); it's punishment prayed for (vv. 6-9); and
the consequent joy of the righteous and widespread
recognition of the rule of a just God (vv. 10, 11).</p>

<p>The abrupt question of ver. 1 speaks of long pent-up
indignation, excited by protracted experience of
injustice, and anticipates the necessary negative answer
which follows. The word rendered by the A.V. and
R.V. "in silence" or "dumb" can scarcely be twisted
into intelligibility, and the small alteration of reading
required for the rendering "gods" is recommended by
the similar expressions in the kindred Psalm lxxxii.
Taken thus, the question is hurled at the appointed
depositaries of judicial power and supreme authority.
There is no need to suppose, with Hupfeld and others,
whom Cheyne follows, that these "gods" are supernatural
beings intrusted with the government of the
world. The explanation of the name lies in the
conception of such power as bestowed by God, and in
some sense a delegation of His attribute; or, as our
Lord explained the similar name in Psalm lxxxii., as
given because "to them the word of God came." It
sets in sinister light the flagrant contradiction between
the spirit in which these men exercised their office
and the source from which they derived it, and thus
sharpens the reproach of the question. The answer is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
introduced by a particle conveying a strong opposition
to the previous supposition couched in the question.
"Heart" and "hands" are so obviously antithetical,
that the alteration of "in heart" to "ye all" is not
acceptable, though it removes the incongruity of plans
being wrought in the heart, the seat of devices, not of
actions. "Work" may be here used anomalously, as
we say "work out," implying the careful preparation
of a plan, and there may even be a hint that the true
acts are the undone acts of the heart. The unaccomplished
purpose is a deed, though never clothed in
outward fact. Evil determined is, in a profound sense,
done before it is done; and, in another equally solemn,
not done when "'tis done," as Macbeth has taught us.
The "act," as men call it, follows: "In the earth"&mdash;not
only in the heart&mdash;"ye weigh out the violence of
your hands." The scales of justice are untrue. Instead
of dispensing equity, as they were bound to do, they
clash into the balance the weight of their own violence.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the psalm says no more about
the sins of unjust authorities, but passes on to describe
the "wicked" generally. The transition may suggest
that under unjust rulers all wrongdoers find impunity,
and so multiply and worsen; or it may simply be that
these former are now merged in the class to which
they belong. The type of "wickedness" gibbeted is
the familiar one of malicious calumniators and persecutors.
From birth onwards they have continuously
been doers of evil. The psalmist is not laying down
theological propositions about heredity, but describing
the inveterate habit of sin which has become a second
nature, and makes amendment hopeless. The reference
to "lies" naturally suggests the image of the serpent's
poison. An envenomed tongue is worse than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
snake's bite. And the mention of the serpent stimulates
the poet's imagination to yet another figure, which puts
most graphically that disregard of warnings, entreaties,
and every voice, human or Divine, that marks long-practised,
customary sinfulness. There can be no more
striking symbol of determined disregard to the calls of
patient Love and the threats of outraged Justice than
that of the snake lying coiled, with its head in the
centre of its motionless folds, as if its ears were
stopped by its own bulk, while the enchanter plays his
softest notes and speaks his strongest spells in vain.
There are such men, thinks this psalmist. There are
none whom the mightiest spell, that of God's love in
Christ, could not conquer and free from their poison;
but there are such as will close their ears to its
plaintive sweetness. This is the condemnation that
light is come and men love darkness, and had rather
lie coiled in their holes than have their fangs extracted.</p>

<p>The general drift of the second part (vv. 6-9) is
to call down Divine retribution on these obstinate,
irreclaimable evil-doers. Figure is heaped on figure
in a fashion suggestive of intense emotion. The
transiency of insolent evil, the completeness of its
destruction, are the thoughts common to them all.
There are difficulties in translation, and, in ver. 9,
probable textual corruption; but these should not hide
the tremendous power of gloomy imagination, which
can lay hold of vulgar and in part loathsome things,
and, by sheer force of its own solemn insight, can free
them from all low or grotesque associations, and turn
them into awful symbols. The intense desire for the
sweeping away of evil-doers has met us in many
previous psalms, and it is needless to repeat former
observations on it. But it is nowhere expressed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
such a wealth of metaphor as here. The first of these,
that of crushing the jaws and breaking the teeth of a
beast of prey, occurs also in Psalm iii. 7. It is less
terrible than the subsequent imprecations, since it only
contemplates the wickeds' deprivation of power to do
harm. In ver. 7 <i>a</i> their destruction is sought, while, in
the second clause of the same verse, the defeat of their
attempts is desired. Ver. 8 then expands the former
wish, and ver. 9 the latter. This plain symmetrical
arrangement makes the proposals to resort to transposition
unnecessary. Mountain torrents quickly run
themselves dry; and the more furious their rush, the
swifter their exhaustion. They leave a chaos of
whitened stones, that lie bleaching in the fierce sun
when the wild spate is past. So stormy and so short
will be the career of evil-doers. So could a good man
of old wish it to be; and so may we be sure of and
desire the cessation of oppression and man's inhumanity
to man. Ver. 7 <i>b</i> is obscure. All these figures are
struck out with such parsimony of words that they
are difficult. They remind one of some of the stern,
unfinished work of Michael Angelo, where a blow or
two of his chisel, or a dash or two of his brush, has
indicated rather than expressed his purpose, and left a
riddle, fascinating in its incompleteness, for smaller
men to spell out. In ver. 7 <i>b</i> it may be asked, Who
is the archer? If God, then the whole is a presentation
as if of an occurrence taking place before our eyes.
God shoots His arrow, and at once it lodges in the heart
of the enemies, and they are as though cut off. But
it is better to take the wicked as the subject of both
verbs, the change from singular to plural being by no
means unusual in successive clauses with the same
subject. If so, this clause recurs to the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
ver. 6, and prays for the neutralising of the wicked
man's attempts. He fits his arrows, aims, and draws
the bow. May they fall harmless, as if barbless!
An emendation has been proposed by which the clause
is made parallel with Psalm xxxvii. 2, "As grass let
them be quickly cut off," thus securing a complete
parallel with <i>a</i>, and avoiding the difficulty in the word
rendered by us "pointless." But the existing text gives
a vigorous metaphor, the peculiarity of which makes it
preferable to the feebler image of withering grass.</p>

<p>The prayer for destruction is caught up again in
ver. 8, in two daring figures which tremble on the
verge of lowering the key of the whole; but by escaping
that peril, produce the contrary effect, and heighten it.
A slug leaves a shining track of slime as it creeps,
which exudes from its soft body, and thus it seems to
disintegrate itself by its own motion. It is the same
thought of the suicidal character of bad men's efforts
which was expressed by the stream foaming itself away
in the nullah. It is the eternal truth that opposition
to God's will destroys itself by its own activity. The
unfulfilled life of a premature birth, with eyes which
never opened to the light for which they were made,
and possibilities which never unfolded, and which is
huddled away into a nameless grave, still more impressively
symbolises futility and transiency.</p>

<p>In ver. 9 the figure has given much trouble to commentators.
Its broad meaning is, however, undoubted.
It is, as ver. 6 and ver. 7 <i>b</i>, symbolic of the Divine
intervention which wrecks wicked men's plans before
they are wrought out. The picture before the psalmist
seems to be that of a company of travellers round their
camp fire, preparing their meal. They heap brushwood
under the pot, and expect to satisfy their hunger;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
but before the pot is warmed through, not to say before
the water boils or the meat is cooked, down comes a
whirlwind, which sweeps away fire, pot, and all. Every
word of the clause is doubtful, and, with the existing
text, the best that can be done is not wholly satisfactory.
If emendation is resorted to, the suggestion
of Bickell, adopted by Cheyne, gives a good sense:
"[And] while your [flesh] is yet raw, the hot wrath
[of Jehovah] shall sweep it away." Baethgen makes a
slighter alteration, and renders, "While it is still raw,
He sweeps it away in wrath." Retaining the existing
text (which is witnessed by the LXX. and other old
versions), probably the best rendering is, "Whether
[it be] green or burning, He shall whirl it away." This
general understanding of the words is shared by commentators
who differ as to what is represented as swept
away,&mdash;some making it the thorn fire, the twigs of which
may be either full of sap or well alight; while others
take the reference to be to the meat in the pot, which
may be either "living," <i>i.e.</i> raw, or well on the way to
being cooked. Neither application is quite free from
difficulty, especially in view of the fact that some
pressure has to be put on the word rendered "burning,"
which is not an adjective, but a noun, and is usually
employed to designate the fiery wrath of God, as it is
rendered in the amended text just mentioned. After
all attempts at clearing up the verse, one must be
content to put a mark of interrogation at any rendering.
But the scope of the figure seems discoverable through
the obscurity. It is a homely and therefore vigorous
picture of half-accomplished plans suddenly reduced to
utter failure, and leaving their concocters hungry for
the satisfaction which seemed so near. The cookery
may go on merrily and the thorns crackle cheerily, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the simoom comes, topples over the tripod on which
the pot swung, and blows the fire away in a hundred
directions. Peter's gibbet was ready, and the morning
of his execution was near; but when day dawned,
"there was no small stir what was become of him."
The wind had blown him away from the expectation of
the people of the Jews into safe quarters; and the fire
was dispersed.</p>

<p>The closing part (vv. 10, 11) breathes a stern spirit
of joy over the destruction of the wicked. That is a
terrible picture of the righteous bathing his feet in the
blood of the wicked (Psalm lxviii. 23). It expresses
not only the dreadful abundance of blood, but also
the satisfaction of the "righteous" at its being shed.
There is an ignoble and there is a noble and Christian
satisfaction in even the destructive providences of God.
It is not only permissible but imperative on those who
would live in sympathy with His righteous dealings
and with Himself, that they should see in these the
manifestation of eternal justice, and should consider
that they roll away burdens from earth and bring hope
and rest to the victims of oppression. It is no unworthy
shout of personal vengeance, nor of unfeeling triumph,
that is lifted up from a relieved world when Babylon
falls. If it is right in God to destroy, it cannot be
wrong in His servants to rejoice that He does. Only
they have to take heed that their emotion is untarnished
by selfish gratulation, and is not untinged with solemn
pity for those who were indeed doers of evil, but were
themselves the greatest sufferers from their evil. It is
hard, but not impossible, to take all that is expressed
in the psalm, and to soften it by some effluence from
the spirit of Him who wept over Jerusalem, and yet
pronounced its doom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>The last issue of God's judgments contemplated by
the psalm warrants the joy of the righteous; for in
these there is a demonstration to the world that there
is "fruit" to the righteous, and that notwithstanding
all bewilderments from the sight of prosperous wickedness
and oppressed righteousness "there is a God
who judges in the earth." The word "judging" is
here in the plural, corresponding with "God" (Elohim),
which is also plural in form. Possibly the construction
is to be explained on the ground that the words describe
the thoughts of surrounding, polytheistic nations,
who behold the exhibition of God's righteousness. But
more probably the plural is here used for the sake of
the contrast with the "gods" of ver. 1. Over these
unworthy representatives of Divine justice sits the true
judge, in the manifoldness of His attributes, exercising
His righteous though slow-footed judgments.</p>

<p>The superscription makes this the earliest of David's
psalms, dating from the Sauline persecution. It
has many points of connection with the others of that
group, but its closest affinities are with Psalm lv., which
is commonly considered to belong to the period of
incubation of Absalom's rebellion (<i>cf.</i> Psalm lv. 10
with lix. 6, 14, and lv. 21 with lix. 7). The allusion
to enemies patrolling the city, which is common to both
psalms, seems to refer to a fact, and may in this psalm
be founded on the watchfulness of Saul's emissaries;
but its occurrence in both weakens its force as here
confirmatory of the superscription. It does not necessarily
follow from the mention of the "nations" that the
psalmist's enemies are foreigners. Their presence in
the city and the stress laid on words as their weapons
are against that supposition. On the whole, the contents
of the psalm do not negative the tradition in the
title, but do not strongly attest it. If we have accepted
the Davidic authorship of the other psalms of this
group, we shall extend it to this one; for they clearly
are a group, whether Davidic or not. The psalm falls
into two principal divisions (vv. 1-9 and 10-17), each
closing with a refrain, and each subdivided into two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
minor sections, the former of which in each case ends
with Selah, and the latter begins with another refrain.
The two parts travel over much the same ground of petition,
description of the enemies, confidence in deliverance
and in the defeat of the foes. But in the first half the
psalmist prays for himself, and in the second he prays
against his persecutors, while assured confidence in his
own deliverance takes the place of alarmed gaze on their
might and cruelty.</p>

<p>The former half of the first part begins and ends with
petitions. Imbedded in these is a plaintive recounting
of the machinations of the adversaries, which are, as it
were, spread before God's eyes, accompanied with protestations
of innocence. The prayers, which enclose,
as in a circlet, this description of unprovoked hatred,
are varied, so that the former petitions are directed to
the singer's deliverance, while the latter invoke judgment
on his antagonists. The strong assertion of
innocence is, of course, to be limited to the psalmist's
conduct to his enemies. They attack him without
provocation. Obviously this feature corresponds to
the facts of Saul's hatred of David, and as obviously
it does not correspond to the facts of Israel's sufferings
from foreign enemies, which are supposed by the present
favourite interpretation to be the occasion of the psalm.
No devout singer could so misunderstand the reason of
the nation's disasters as to allege that they had fallen
upon innocent heads. Rather, when a psalmist bewailed
national calamities, he traced them to national
sins. "Anger went up against Israel, because they
believed not in God." The psalmist calls God to look
upon the doings of his enemies. Privy plots and open
assaults are both directed against him. The enemy
lie in wait for his life; but also, with fell eagerness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
like that of soldiers making haste to rank themselves
in battle-array, they "run and set themselves."
This is probably simply metaphor, for the rest of the
psalm does not seem to contemplate actual warfare.
The imminence of peril forces an urgent prayer from
the threatened man. So urgent is it that it breaks in on
the parallelism of ver. 4, substituting its piercing cry
"Awake, behold!" for the proper second clause carrying
on the description in the first. The singer makes haste
to grasp God's hand, because he feels the pressure of
the wind blowing in his face. It is wise to break off
the contemplation of enemies and dangers by crying to
God. Prayer is a good interruption of a catalogue of
perils. The petitions in ver. 5 are remarkable, both
in their accumulation of the Divine names and in their
apparent transcending of the suppliant's need. The
former characteristic is no mere artificial or tautological
heaping together of titles, but indicates repeated acts of
faith and efforts of contemplation. Each name suggests
something in God which encourages hope, and when
appealed to by a trusting soul, moves Him to act. The
very introductory word of invocation, "And Thou," is
weighty. It sets the might of God in grand contrast
to the hurrying hatred of the adversary; and its significance
is enhanced if its recurrence in ver. 8 and its
relation to "And I" in ver. 16 are taken into account.</p>

<p>The combination of the Divine names is remarkable
here, from the insertion of God (Elohim) between the
two parts of the standing name, Jehovah of hosts.
The anomaly is made still more anomalous by the
peculiar form of the word Elohim, which does not
undergo the modification to be expected in such a
construction. The same peculiarities occur in other
Elohistic psalms (lxxx. 4, 19, and lxxxiv. 8). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
peculiar grammatical form would be explained if the
three words were regarded as three co-ordinate names,
Jehovah, Elohim, Zebaoth, and this explanation is
favoured by good critics. But it is going too far to
say, with Baethgen, that "Zebaoth <i>can only</i> be understood
as an independent Divine name" (Komm., <i>in loc.</i>).
Other explanations are at least possible, such as that
of Delitzsch, that "Elohim, like Jehovah, has become a
proper name," and so does not suffer modification.
The supplicatory force of the names, however, is clear,
whatever may be the account of the formal anomalies.
They appeal to God and they hearten the appellant's confidence
by setting forth the loftiness of God, who rules
over the embattled forces of the universe, which "run
and set themselves in array" at His bidding and for His
servant's help, and before which the ranks of the foes
seem thin and few. They set forth also God's relation
to Israel, of which the single suppliant is a member.</p>

<p>The petition, grounded upon these names, is supposed
by modern commentators to prove that the psalmist's
enemies were heathens, which would, of course, destroy
the Davidic authorship, and make the singer a personification
of the nation. But against this is to be
observed the description of the enemies in the last
clause of ver. 5 as "apostates," which must refer to
Israelites. The free access to the "city," spoken of
in ver. 6, is also unfavourable to that supposition, as
is the prominence given to the <i>words</i> of the enemy.
Foreign foes would have had other swords than those
carried between their lips. The prayer that Jehovah
would arise to visit "all nations" is much more
naturally explained, as on the same principle as the
judgment of "the peoples" in Psalm vii. All special
cases are subsumed under the one general judgment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
The psalmist looks for his own deliverance as one
instance of that world-wide manifestation of Divine
justice which will "render to every man according to
his deeds." Not only personal considerations move
him to his prayer; but, pressing as these are, and
shrill as is the cry for personal deliverance, the psalmist
is not so absorbed in self as that he cannot widen
his thoughts and desires to a world-wide manifestation
of Divine righteousness, of which his own escape will
be a tiny part. Such recognition of the universal in
the particular is the prerogative in lower walks of the
poet and the man of genius; it is the strength and
solace of the man who lives by faith and links all
things with God. The instruments here strike in, so
as to fix attention on the spectacle of God aroused to
smite and of the end of apostates.</p>

<p>The comparison of the psalmist's enemies to dogs
occurs in another psalm ascribed to David (xxii. 16, 20).
They are like the masterless, gaunt, savage curs which
infest the streets of Eastern cities, hungrily hunting for
offal and ready to growl or snarl at every passer-by.
Though the dog is not a nocturnal animal, evening
would naturally be a time when these would specially
prowl round the city in search of food, if disappointed
during the day. The picture suggests the enemies'
eagerness, lawlessness, foulness, and persistency. If
the psalm is rightly dated in the superscription, it
finds most accurate realisation in the crafty, cruel
watchfulness of Saul's spies. The word rendered by
the A.V. and R.V. "make a noise" is "said usually of
the growling of the bear and the cooing of the dove"
(Delitzsch). It indicates a lower sound than barking,
and so expresses rage suppressed lest its object should
take alarm. The word rendered (A.V. and R.V.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
"belch" means to gush out, and is found in a good
sense in Psalm xix. 1. Here it may perhaps be taken
as meaning "foam," with some advantage to the truth
of the picture. "Swords are in their lips"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, their
talk is of slaying the psalmist, or their slanders cut
like swords; and the crown of their evil is their scoff
at the apparently deaf and passive God.</p>

<p>With startling suddenness, as if one quick touch
drew aside a curtain, the vision of God as He really
regards the enemies is flashed on them in ver. 8.
The strong antithesis expressed by the "And Thou,"
as in ver. 5, comes with overwhelming force. Below
is the crowd of greedy foes, obscene, cruel, and blasphemous;
above, throned in dread repose, which is not,
as they dream, carelessness or ignorance, is Jehovah,
mocking their fancied security. The tremendous
metaphor of the laughter of God is too boldly anthropomorphic
to be misunderstood. It sounds like the germ
of the solemn picture in Psalm ii., and is probably the
source of the similar expression in Psalm xxxvii. 13.
The introduction of the wider thought of God's
"mocking"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, discerning, and manifesting in act, the
impotence of the ungodly efforts of "all nations"&mdash;is
to be accounted for on the same principle of the close
connection discerned by the devout singer between the
particular and the general, which explains the similar
extension of view in ver. 5.</p>

<p>Ver. 9 is the refrain closing the first part. The
reading of the Hebrew text, "His strength," must be
given up, as unintelligible, and the slight alteration
required for reading "my" instead of "his" adopted,
as in the second instance of the refrain in ver. 17. The
further alteration of text, however, by which "I will
harp" would be read in ver. 9 instead of "I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
watch" is unnecessary, and the variation of the two
refrains is not only in accordance with usage, but
brings out a delicate phase of progress in confidence.
He who begins with waiting for God ends with singing
praise to God. The silence of patient expectance is
changed for the melody of received deliverance.</p>

<p>The first part of the second division, like the
corresponding portion of the fist division, is mainly
prayer, but with the significant difference that the
petitions now are directed, not to the psalmist's
deliverance, but to his enemies' punishment. For
himself, he is sure that his God will come to meet him
with His loving-kindness, and that, thus met and helped,
he will look on, secure, at their ruin. The Hebrew
margin proposes to read "The God of my loving-kindness
will meet me"&mdash;an incomplete sentence, which
does not tell with what God will meet him. But the
text needs only the change of one vowel point in order
to yield the perfectly appropriate reading, "my God
shall meet me with His loving-kindness," which is
distinctly to be preferred. It is singular that the
substitution of "my" for "his," which is needlessly
suggested by the Hebrew margin for ver. 10, is required
but not suggested for ver. 9. One is tempted to
wonder whether there has been a scribe's blunder
attaching the correction to the wrong verse. The
central portion of this part of the psalm is composed of
terrible wishes for the enemies' destruction. There is
nothing more awful in the imprecations of the Psalter
than that petition that the boon of a swift end to
their miseries may not be granted them. The dew of
pity for suffering is dried up by the fire of stern desire
for the exhibition of a signal instance of Divine judicial
righteousness. That desire lifts the prayer above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
level of personal vengeance, but does not lighten its
awfulness. There may be an allusion to the fate of
Cain, who was kept alive and made a "fugitive and a
vagabond." Whether that is so or not, the wish that
the foes may be kept alive to be buffeted by God's
<i>strength</i>&mdash;or, as the word may mean, to be scattered in
panic-struck rout by God's <i>army</i>&mdash;is one which marks
the difference between the old and the new covenants.
The ground of these fearful punishments is vehemently
set forth in ver. 12. Every word which the adversaries
speak is sin. Their own self-sufficient pride, which is
revolt against dependence on God, is like a trap to
catch them. They speak curses and lies, for which
retribution is due. This recounting of their crimes,
not so much against the psalmist, though involving
him, as against God, fires his indignation anew, and he
flames out with petitions which seem to forget the
former ones for lingering destruction: "End them in
wrath, end them." The contradiction may be apparent
only, and this passionate cry may presuppose the fulfilment
of the former. The psalmist will then desire two
dreadful things&mdash;first, protracted suffering, and then a
crushing blow to end it. His ultimate desire in both is
the same. He would have the evil-doers spared long
enough to be monuments of God's punitive justice; he
would have them ended, that the crash of their fall
may reverberate afar and proclaim that God rules in
Jacob. "Unto the ends of the earth" may be connected
either with "rules" or with "know." In the
former construction the thought will be, that from His
throne in Israel God exercises dominion universally;
in the latter, that the echo of the judgment on these
evil-doers will reach distant lands. The latter meaning
is favoured by the accents, and is, on the whole, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
preferred. But what a strange sense of his own significance
for the manifestation of God's power to the
world this singer must have had, if he could suppose
that the events of his life were thus of universal importance!
One does not wonder that the advocates of the
personification theory find strong confirmation of it in
such utterances; and, indeed, the only other explanation
of them is that the psalmist held, and knew himself
to hold, a conspicuous place in the evolution of the
Divine purpose, so that in his life, as in a small mirror,
there were reflected great matters. If such anticipations
were more than wild dreams, the cherisher of
them must either have been speaking in the person of
the nation, or he must have known himself to be God's
instrument for extending His name through the world.
No single person so adequately meets the requirements
of such words as David.</p>

<p>The second part of this division (ver. 14) begins with
the same words as the corresponding part of the first
division (ver. 6), so that there is a kind of refrain here.
The futures in vv. 14, 15, may be either simple futures
or optatives. In the latter case the petitions of the
preceding verses would be continued here, and the
pregnant truth would result that continuance in sin is
the punishment of sin. But probably the imprecations
are better confined to the former part, as the Selah
draws a broad line of demarcation, and there would be
an incongruity in following the petition "End them"
with others which contemplated the continuance of the
enemies. If the verses are taken as simply predictive,
the point of the reintroduction of the figure of the
pack of dogs hunting for their prey lies in ver. 15.
There they are described as balked in their attempts,
and having to pass the night unsatisfied. Their prey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
has escaped. Their eager chase, their nocturnal quest,
their growling and prowling, have been vain. They lie
down empty and in the dark&mdash;a vivid picture, which
has wider meanings than its immediate occasion. "Ye
lust and desire to have, and cannot obtain." An eternal
nemesis hangs over godless lives, condemning them to
hunger, after all efforts, and wrapping their pangs of
unsatisfied desire in tragic darkness.</p>

<p>A clear strain of trust springs up, like a lark's
morning song. The singer contrasts himself with his
baffled foes. The "they" at the beginning of ver. 15
is emphatic in the Hebrew, and is matched with the
emphatic "And I" which begins ver. 16. His "morning"
is similarly set over against their "night." So
petition, complaint, imprecation, all merge into a song
of joy and trust, and the whole ends with the refrain
significantly varied and enlarged. In its first form the
psalmist said, "For Thee will I watch"; in its second
he rises to "To Thee will I harp." Glad praise is ever
the close of the vigils of a faithful, patient heart. The
deliverance won by waiting and trust should be celebrated
by praise. In the first form the refrain ran
"God is my high tower," and the second part of the
psalm began with "My God shall meet me with His
loving-kindness." In its second form the refrain draws
into itself these words which had followed it, and so
modifies them that the loving-kindness which in them
was contemplated as belonging to and brought by God
is now joyfully clasped by the singer as his very own, by
Divine gift and through his own acceptance. Blessed
they who are led by occasion of foes and fears to take
God's rich gifts, and can thankfully and humbly feel
that His loving-kindness and all its results are theirs,
because He Himself is theirs and they are His!</p>

</p>


<p>This psalm has evidently a definite historical background.
Israel has been worsted in fight, but
still continues its campaign against Edom. Meditating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
on God's promises, the psalmist anticipates victory,
which will cover defeat and perfect partial successes,
and seeks to breathe his own spirit of confidence into
the ranks of his countrymen. But the circumstances
answering to those required by the psalm are hard to
find. The date assigned by the superscription cannot
be called satisfactory; for David's war there referred to
(2 Sam. viii.) had no such stunning defeats as are here
lamented. The Divine Oracle, of which the substance
is given in the central part of the psalm, affords but
dubious indications of date. At first sight it seems to
imply the union of all the tribes in one kingdom, and
therefore to favour the Davidic authorship. But it
may be a question whether the united Israel of the
Oracle is fact or prophecy. To one school of commentators,
the mention of Ephraim in conjunction with
Judah is token that the psalm is prior to the great
revolt; to another, it is proof positive that the date is
after the destruction of the northern kingdom. The
Maccabean date is favoured by Olshausen, Hitzig, and
Cheyne among moderns; but, apart from other objections,
the reappearance of vv. 5-12 in Psalm cviii.
implies that this piece of Hebrew psalmody was
already venerable when a later compiler wove part
of it into that psalm. On the whole, the Davidic
authorship is possible, though clogged with the difficulty
already mentioned. But the safest conclusion seems
to be Baethgen's modest one, which contrasts strongly
with the confident assertions of some other critics&mdash;namely,
that assured certainty in dating the psalm "is
no longer possible."</p>

<p>It falls into three parts of four verses each, of which
the first (vv. 1-4) is complaint of defeat and prayer for
help; the second (vv. 5-8), a Divine Oracle assuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
victory; and the third (vv. 9-12), the flash of fresh
hope kindled by that God's-word.</p>

<p>The first part blends complaint and prayer in the
first pair of verses, in each of which there is, first, a
description of the desperate state of Israel, and then
a cry for help. The nation is broken, as a wall
is broken down, or as an army whose ordered ranks
are shattered and scattered. Some crushing defeat is
meant, which in ver. 2 is further described as an earthquake.
The land trembles, and then gapes in hideous
clefts, and houses become gaunt ruins. The state is
disorganised as in consequence of defeat. It is an
unpoetical mixture of fact and figure to see in the
"rending" of the land allusion to the separation of
the kingdoms, especially as that was not the result of
defeat.</p>

<p>There is almost a tone of wonder in the designation
of Israel as "Thy people," so sadly does the fate meted
out to them contrast with their name. Stranger still
and more anomalous is it, that, as ver. 3 <i>b</i> laments, God's
own hand has commended such a chalice to their lips
as should fill them with infatuation. The construction
"wine of reeling" is grammatically impossible, and the
best explanation of the phrase regards the nouns as in
apposition&mdash;"wine which is reeling," or "reeling as
wine." The meaning is that God not only sent the
disaster which had shaken the nation like an earthquake,
but had sent, too, the presumptuous self-confidence
which had led to it.</p>

<p>Ver. 4 has received two opposite interpretations, being
taken by some as a prolongation of the tone of lament
over disaster, and by others as commemoration of God's
help. The latter meaning violently interrupts the
continuity of thought. "The only natural view is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
which sees" in ver. 4 "a continuation of the description
of calamity" in ver. 3 (Cheyne, <i>in loc.</i>). Taking
this view, we render the second clause as above.
The word translated "that they may flee" may indeed
mean to lift themselves up, in the sense of gathering
round a standard, but the remainder of the clause
cannot be taken as meaning "because of the truth,"
since the preposition here used never means "because
of." It is best taken here as <i>from before</i>. The word
variously rendered <i>bow</i> and <i>truth</i> is difficult. It occurs
again in Prov. xxii. 21, and is there parallel with
"truth" or faithfulness in fulfilling Divine promises.
But that meaning would be inappropriate here, and
would require the preceding preposition to be taken
in the impossible sense already noted. It seems better,
therefore, to follow the LXX. and other old versions,
in regarding the word as a slightly varied mode of
spelling the ordinary word for a bow (the final dental
letter being exchanged for a cognate dental). The
resulting meaning is deeply coloured by sad irony.
"Thou hast indeed given a banner&mdash;but it was a
signal for flight rather than for gathering round." Such
seems the best view of this difficult verse; but it is not
free from objection. "Those who fear Thee" is not
a fitting designation for persons who were thus scattered
in flight by God, even if it is taken as simply a synonym
for the nation. We have to make choice between
two incongruities. If we adopt the favourite view, that
the verse continues the description of calamity, the
name given to the sufferers is strange. If we take
the other, that it describes God's gracious rallying of
the fugitives, we are confronted with a violent interruption
of the tone of feeling in this first part of the
psalm. Perowne accepts the rendering <i>from before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the bow</i>, but takes the verb in the sense of mustering
round, so making the banner to be a rallying-point, and
the giving of it a Divine mercy.</p>

<p>The second part (vv. 5-8) begins with a verse which
Delitzsch and others regard as really connected, notwithstanding
the Selah at the end ver. 4, with the
preceding. But it is quite intelligible as independent,
and is in its place as the introduction to the Divine
Oracle which follows, and makes the kernel of the
psalm. There is beautiful strength of confidence in
the psalmist's regarding the beaten, scattered people
as still God's "darlings." He appeals to Him to
answer, in order that a result so accordant with God's
heart as the deliverance of His beloved ones may be
secured. And the prayer has no sooner passed his
lips than he hears the thunderous response, "God has
spoken in His holiness." That infinite elevation of
His nature above creatures is the pledge of the fulfilment
of His word.</p>

<p>The following verses contain the substance of the
Oracle; but it is too daring to suppose that they reproduce
its words; for "I will exult" can scarcely be
reverently put into the mouth of God. The substance
of the whole is a twofold promise&mdash;of a united Israel,
and a submissive heathendom. Shechem on the west
and Succoth on the east of Jordan, Gilead and
Manasseh on the east, and Ephraim and Judah on the
west, are the possession of the speaker, whether he is
king or representative of the nation. No trace of a
separation of the kingdoms is here. Ephraim, the
strongest tribe of the northern kingdom, is the "strength
of my head," the helmet, or perhaps with allusion to
the horns of an animal as symbols of offensive weapons.
Judah is the ruling tribe, the commander's baton, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
possibly "lawgiver," as in Gen. xlix. Israel thus compact
together may count on conquests over hereditary
foes.</p>

<p>Their defeat is foretold in contemptuous images.
The basin for washing the feet was "a vessel unto
dishonour"; and, in Israel's great house, no higher
function for his ancestral enemy, when conquered,
would be found. The meaning of casting the shoe
upon or over Edom is doubtful. It may be a symbol
for taking possession of property, though that lacks
confirmation; or Edom may be regarded as the household
slave to whom the master's shoes are thrown
when taken off; or, better, in accordance with the
preceding reference to Moab, Edom may be regarded
as part of the master's house or furniture. The one
was the basin for his feet; the other, the corner where
he kept his sandals.</p>

<p>If the text of ver. 8 <i>c</i> is correct, Philistia is addressed
with bitter sarcasm, and bidden to repeat her
ancient shouts of triumph over Israel now, if she can.
But the edition of these verses in Psalm cviii. gives
a more natural reading, which may be adopted here:
"Over Philistia will I shout aloud."</p>

<p>The third part (vv. 9-12) is taken by some commentators
to breathe the same spirit as the first part.
Cheyne, for instance, speaks of it as a "relapse into
despondency," whilst others more truly hear in it the
tones of rekindled trust. In ver. 9 there is a remarkable
change of tense from "Who will bring?" in the
first clause, to "Who has guided?" in the second.
This is best explained by the supposition that some
victory over Edom had preceded the psalm, which
is regarded by the singer as a guarantee of success
in his assault of "the fenced city," probably Petra.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
There is no need to supplement ver. 10, so as to read,
"Wilt not Thou, O God, which," etc. The psalmist
recurs to his earlier lament, not as if he thought that
it still held true, but just because it does not. It
explained the reason of past disasters; and, being now
reversed by the Divine Oracle, becomes the basis of
the prayer which follows. It is as if he had said,
"We were defeated because Thou didst cast us off.
Now help as Thou hast promised, and we shall do
deeds of valour." It is impossible to suppose that the
result of the Divine answer which makes the very
heart of the psalm, should be a hopeless repetition of
the initial despondency. Rather glad faith acknowledges
past weakness and traces past failures to self-caused
abandonment by a loving God, who let His
people be worsted that they might learn who was
their strength, and ever goes forth with those who
go forth to war with the consciousness that all help
but His is vain, and with the hope that in Him even
their weakness shall do deeds of prowess. "Hast not
Thou cast us off?" may be the utterance of despair;
but it may also be that of assured confidence, and the
basis of a prayer that will be answered by God's
present help.</p>

<p>The situation of the singer in this psalm is the
same as in Psalm lxiii. In both he is an exile
longing for the sanctuary, and in both "the king" is
referred to in a way which leaves his identity with the
psalmist questionable. There are also similarities in
situation, sentiment, and expression with Psalms xlii.
and xliii.&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the singers exile, his yearning to appear
in the sanctuary, the command given by God to His
Loving-kindness (xlii. 8 and lxi. 8), the personification
of Light and Troth as his guides (xliii. 3), compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
with the similar representation here of Loving-kindness
and Troth as guards set by God over the psalmist.
The traditional attribution of the psalm to David has at
least the merit of providing an appropriate setting for
its longings and hopes, in his flight from Absalom.
No one of the other dates proposed by various critics
seems to satisfy anybody but its proposer. Hupfeld
calls Hitzig's suggestion "wunderbar zu lesen." Graetz
inclines to the reign of Hezekiah and thinks that "the
connection gains" if the prayer for the preservation of
the king's life refers to that monarch's sickness. The
Babylonish captivity, with Zedekiah for "the king," is
preferred by others. Still later dates are in favour
now. Cheyne lays it down that "pre-Jeremian such
highly spiritual hymns (<i>i.e.</i>, Psalms lxi. and lxiii.)
obviously cannot be," and thinks that "it would not
be unplausible to make them contemporaneous with
Psalm xlii., the king being Antiochus the Great," but
prefers to assign them to the Maccabean period, and to
take "Jonathan, or (better) Simon" as the king. Are
"highly spiritual hymns" probable products of that
time?</p>

<p>If the Selah is accepted as marking the end of the
first part of the psalm, its structure is symmetrical, so
far as it is then divided into two parts of four verses
each; but that division cuts off the prayer in ver. 4
from its ground in ver. 5. Selah frequently occurs in
the middle of a period, and is used to mark emphasis,
but not necessarily division. It is therefore better to
keep vv. 4 and 5 together, thus preserving their analogy
with vv. 2 and 3. The scheme of this little psalm
will then be an introductory verse, followed by two
parallel pairs of verses, each consisting of petition and
its grounding in past mercies (vv. 2, 3, and 4, 5), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
these again succeeded by another pair containing
petitions for the king, while a final single verse,
corresponding to the introductory one, joyfully foresees
life-long praise evoked by the certain answers to the
singer's prayer.</p>

<p>The fervour of the psalmist's supplication is strikingly
expressed by his use in the first clause, of the word
which is ordinarily employed for the shrill notes of
rejoicing. It describes the quality of the sound as
penetrating and emotional, not the nature of the emotion
expressed by it. Joy is usually louder-tongued than
sorrow; but this suppliant's need has risen so high that
his cry is resonant. To himself he seems to be at
"the end of the earth"; for he measures distance not as
a map-maker, but as a worshipper. Love and longing
are potent magnifiers of space. His heart "faints," or is
"overwhelmed." The word means literally "covered,"
and perhaps the metaphor may be preserved by some
such phrase as <i>wrapped in gloom</i>. He is, then, an
exile, and therefore sunk in sadness. But while he had
external separation from the sanctuary chiefly in view,
his cry wakes an echo in all devout hearts. They who
know most about the inner life of communion with God
best know how long and dreary the smallest separation
between Him and them seems, and how thick is the
covering spread over the heart thereby.</p>

<p>The one desire of such a suppliant is for restoration
of interrupted access to God. The psalmist embodies
that yearning in its more outward form, but not
without penetrating to the inner reality in both the
parallel petitions which follow. In the first of these,
(ver. 2 <i>b</i>) the thought is fuller than the condensed
expression of it. "Lead me on" or in, says he, meaning,
Lead me <i>to</i> and set me <i>on</i>. His imagination sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
towering above him a great cliff, on which, if he could
be planted, he might defy pursuit or assault. But he
is distant from it, and the inaccessibility which, were
he in its clefts, would be his safety, is now his despair.
Therefore he turns to God and asks Him to bear him
up in His hands, that he may set his foot on that rock.
The figure has been, strangely enough, interpreted to
mean a rock of difficulty, but against the usage in the
Psalter. But we do not reach the whole significance of
the figure if we give it the mere general meaning
of a place of safety. While it would be too much to
say that "rock" is here an epithet of God (the absence
of the definite article and other considerations are
against that), it may be affirmed that the psalmist, like
all devout men, knew that his only place of safety was
in God. "<i>A</i> rock" will not afford adequate shelter;
our perils and storms need "<i>the</i> Rock." And, therefore,
this singer bases his prayer on his past experience
of the safe hiding that he had found in God. Place
of refuge and strong tower are distinctly parallel
with "rock." The whole, then, is like the prayer in
Psalm xxxi. 2, 3: "Be Thou to me a strong rock. For
Thou art my rock."</p>

<p>The second pair of verses, containing petition and
its ground in past experience (vv. 4, 5), brings out still
more clearly the psalmist's longing for the sanctuary.
The futures in ver. 4 may be taken either as simple
expressions of certainty, or, more probably, as precative,
as is suggested by the parallelism with the preceding pair.
The "tent" of God is the sanctuary, possibly so called
because at the date of the psalm "the ark of God
dwelt in curtains." The "hiding-place of Thy wings"
may then be an allusion to the Shechinah and outspread
pinions of the Cherubim. But the inner reality is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
to the psalmist than the external symbols, however his
faith was trained to connect the two more indissolubly
than is legitimate for us. His longing was no superstitious
wish to be near that sanctuary, as if external
presence brought blessing, but a reasonable longing,
grounded on the fact for his stage of revelation, that
such presence was the condition of fullest realisation
of spiritual communion, and of the safety and blessedness
thence received. His prayer is the deepest desire
of every soul that has rightly apprehended the facts of
life, its own needs and the riches of God. The guests
in God's dwelling have guest-rights of provision and
protection. Beneath His wings are safety, warmth,
and conscious nearness to His heart. The suppliant
may feel far off, at the end of the world; but one
strong desire has power to traverse all the distance in a
moment. "Where the treasure is, there will the heart
be also"; and where the heart is, there the man is.</p>

<p>The ground of this second petition is laid in God's
past listening to vows, and His having given the
psalmist "the heritage of those that fear Thy name."
That is most naturally explained as meaning primarily
the land of Israel, and as including therein all
other blessings needful for life there. While it is
capable of being otherwise understood, it is singularly
appropriate to the person of David during the period
of Absalom's rebellion, when victory was beginning to
declare itself for the king. If we suppose that he had
already won a battle (2 Sam. xviii. 6), we can understand
how he takes that success as an omen and urges
it as a plea. The pair of verses will then be one
instance of the familiar argument which trustful hearts
instinctively use, when they present past and incomplete
mercies as reasons for continued gifts, and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
addition of all which is needed to "perfect that which
concerneth" them. It rests on the confidence that
God is not one who "begins and is not able to finish."</p>

<p>Very naturally, then, follows the closing prayer in
vv. 6, 7. The purely individual character of the rest
of the psalm, which is resumed in the last verse, where
the singer, speaking in the first person, represents his
continual praise as the result of the answer to his
petitions for the king, makes these petitions hopelessly
irrelevant, unless the psalmist is the king and these
prayers are for himself. The transition to the third
person does not necessarily negative this interpretation,
which seems to be required by the context. The
prayer sounds hyperbolical, but has a parallel in Psalm
xxi. 4, and need not be vindicated by taking the
dynasty rather than the individual to be meant, or by
diverting it to a Messianic reference. It is a prayer
for length of days, in order that the deliverance already
begun may be perfected, and that the psalmist may
dwell in the house of the Lord for ever (<i>cf.</i> Psalms xxiii.
6; xxvii. 4). He asks that he may sit enthroned before
God for ever&mdash;that is, that his dominion may by God's
favour be established and his throne upheld in peace.
The psalm is in so far Messianic that the everlasting
kingdom of the Christ alone fulfils its prayer.</p>

<p>The final petition has, as has been noticed above,
parallels in Psalms xlii., xliii., to which may be added
the personifications of Goodness and Loving-kindness
in Psalm xxiii. 6. These bright harnessed angels
stand sentries over the devout suppliant, set on their
guard by the great Commander; and no harm can
come to him over whom God's Loving-kindness and
Faithfulness keep daily and nightly watch.</p>

<p>Thus guarded, the psalmist's prolonged life will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
one long anthem of praise, and the days added to his
days will be occupied with the fulfilment of his vows
made in trouble and redeemed in his prosperity. What
congruity is there between this closing verse, which is
knit closely to the preceding by that "So," and the
previous pair of verses, unless the king is himself the
petitioner? "Let <i>him</i> sit before God for ever"&mdash;how
comes that to lead up to "So will <i>I</i> harp to Thy name
for ever"? Surely the natural answer is, Because
"he" and "I" are the same person.</p>

</p>


<p>There are several points of affinity between this
psalm and the thirty-ninth,&mdash;such as the frequent
use of the particle of asseveration or restriction ("surely"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
or "only"); the rare and beautiful word for "silence,"
as expressing restful, still resignation; and the characterisation
of men as "vanity." These resemblances are
not proofs of identity of authorship, though establishing
a presumption in its favour. Delitzsch accepts the
psalm as Davidic, and refers it to the time of Absalom's
revolt. The singer is evidently in a position of dignity
("elevation," ver. 4), and one whose exhortations come
with force to the "people" (ver. 8), whether that word
is understood as designating the nation or his immediate
followers. Cheyne, who relegates the psalm to the
Persian period, feels that the recognition of the singer
as "a personage who is the Church's bulwark" is the
natural impression on reading the psalm ("Orig. of
Psalt.," 227, and 242, <i>n.</i>). If so, David's position is
precisely that which is required. Whoever sang this
immortal psalm, rose to the heights of conquering faith,
and gave voice to the deepest and most permanent
emotions of devout souls.</p>

<p>The psalm is in three strophes of four verses each,
the divisions being marked by Selah. The two former
have a long refrain at the beginning, instead of, as
usually, at the end. In the first the psalmist sets his
quiet trust in contrast with the furious assaults of his
foes; while, in the second, he stirs himself to renewed
exercise of it, and exhorts others to share with him
in the security of God as a place of refuge. In
the third strophe the nothingness of man is set in
strong contrast to the power and loving-kindness of
God, and the dehortation from trust in material wealth
urged as the negative side of the previous exhortation
to trust in God.</p>

<p>The noble saying of ver. 1 <i>a</i> is hard to translate
without weakening. The initial word may have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
meanings of "Only" or "Surely." The former seems
more appropriate in this psalm, where it occurs six
times, in one only of which (ver. 4) does the latter
seem the more natural rendering, though even there
the other is possible. It is, however, to be noticed
that its restrictive power is not always directed to the
adjacent word; and here it may either present God as
the exclusive object of the psalmist's waiting trust, or
his whole soul as being nothing else but silent resignation.
The reference to God is favoured by ver. 2, but
the other is possible. The psalmist's whole being is,
as it were, but one stillness of submission. The noises
of contending desires, the whispers of earthly hopes,
the mutterings of short-sighted fears, the self-asserting
accents of an insisting will, are hushed, and all his
nature waits mutely for God's voice. No wonder that
a psalm which begins thus should end with "God
hath spoken once, twice have I heard this"; for such
waiting is never in vain. The soul that cleaves to
God is still; and, being still, is capable of hearing the
Divine whispers which deepen the silence which they
bless. "There is no joy but calm"; and the secret of
calm is to turn the current of the being to God. Then
it is like a sea at rest.</p>

<p>The psalmist's silence finds voice, which does not
break it, in saying over to himself what God is to him.
His accumulation of epithets reminds us of Psalm xviii.
1, 2. Not only does his salvation come from God, but
God Himself is the salvation which He sends forth like
an angel. The recognition of God as his defence is
the ground of "silence"; for if He is "my rock and my
salvation," what can be wiser than to keep close to Him,
and let Him do as He will? The assurance of personal
safety is inseparable from such a thought of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Nothing which does not shake the rock can shake the
frail tent pitched on it. As long as the tower stands,
its inhabitant can look down from his inaccessible
fastness with equanimity, though assailed by crowds.
Thus the psalmist turns swiftly, in the latter pair of
verses making up the first strophe, to address remonstrances
to his enemies, as engaged in a useless effort,
and then drops direct address and speaks <i>of</i> their
hostility and treachery. The precise meaning of parts
of ver. 3 has been misapprehended, by reason of the
peculiarities of some of the words and the condensed
character of the imagery in <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>. The rendering above
is substantially that generally accepted now. It sets in
striking contrast the single figure of the psalmist and
the multitude of his assailants. "All of you" rush
upon a man like a pack of hounds on one defenceless
creature, and try to break him down, as men put their
shoulders to a wall in order to overthrow it. The partial
success of the assault is hinted in the epithets applied
to wall and fence, which are painted as beginning to
give under pressure. Language of confidence sounds
strangely in such circumstances. But the toppling
wall, with all these strong men pushing at it, will "not
be greatly moved." The assailants might answer the
psalmist's "How long?" with defiant confidence that a
short time only was needed to complete the begun ruin;
but he, firm in his faith, though tottering in his fortunes,
knows better, and, in effect, tells them by his question
that, however long they may press against his feebleness,
they will never overthrow him. The bulging wall
outlasts its would-be destroyers. But appeal to them
is vain; for they have one settled purpose absorbing
them&mdash;namely, to cast him down from his height. He
is, then, probably in some position of distinction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
threatened by false friends, who are plotting his deposition,
while their words are fair. All these circumstances
agree well with the Davidic authorship.</p>

<p>The second strophe reiterates the refrain, with slight
but significant variations, and substitutes for the address
to and contemplation of the plotters a meditation on
the psalmist's own security, and an invitation to others
to share it. In ver. 5 the refrain is changed from a
declaration of the psalmist's silent waiting to self-exhortation
thereto. Cheyne would assimilate the two
verses by making both verbs imperatives; but that
change destroys the beautiful play of feeling, so true to
experience, which passes from consciousness of one's
attitude towards God to effort at preserving it. No
emotions, however blessed, deep, and real, will last,
unless perpetually renewed. Like carbon points in
electric lights, they burn away as they burn, and the
light dies, unless there is some impulse which presses
a fresh surface forward to receive the fiery kiss that
changes its blackness into radiance. The "expectation"
in ver. 5 <i>b</i> is substantially equivalent to the
"salvation" in ver. 1 <i>b</i>. It means not the emotion
(which could not be said to be "from Him"), but the
thing expected, just as "hope" is used for the <i>res sperata</i>.
The change in expression from "salvation" to "expectation"
makes prominent the psalmist's attitude. In
his silence his wistful eyes look up, watching for the
first far-off brightening which tells him that help is
on its road from the throne. Salvation will not come
unexpected, and expectation will not look for succours
in vain.</p>

<p>There may be deep meaning in the slight omission
of "greatly" in the second refrain. Confidence has
grown. The first hope was that the waiting heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
should not be much shaken, that the tottering fence
should not be quite thrown down; the second is that
it shall not be shaken at all. An access of faith has
poured into the singer's soul with his song; and now
he has no thought of the crowd of assailants, who have
faded from his sight because he is gazing on God.
Hence the second pair of verses in this strophe (vv. 7,
8) substitutes for the description of their fierce rush the
triumphant reiteration of what God is to the psalmist,
and an invitation to others to come with him into that
strong refuge. The transition to addressing the
"people" is natural, if the psalm is David's. The
phrase would then apply to his immediate followers,
who were one with him in peril, and whom he would
fain have one with him in trust. But the LXX. has
another reading, which involves only the insertion of
a letter, that may easily have dropped out, in the word
rendered "time," and which makes the verse run more
smoothly. It reads "all the congregation of the
people," in which it is followed by Baethgen, Cheyne,
and others. Whoever the psalmist was, he felt the
impulse which follows all deep experience of the
security that comes from hiding in God&mdash;namely, the
longing to beckon in others out of the storm into peace.
Every man who has learned that God is a refuge for
him is thereby assured that He is the same for all men,
and thereby moved to beseech them to make the like
blessed discovery. The way into that hiding-place is
trust. "Pour out before Him your heart," says the
psalmist. "In everything by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving let your requests be made known
unto God," says Paul. They both mean the same thing.
We take refuge in our refuge when we set our faith on
God, and tell Him all that threatens or troubles us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
When we do, we are no longer in the open, defenceless
before the rush of enemies, but housed in God, or, as
Paul puts it, guarded in Christ Jesus, as in a fortress.
No wonder that the psalm pauses for a moment on that
thought, and lets the notes of harp and horn impress it
on the listeners!</p>

<p>The third strophe sets the emptiness of men in strong
contrast to the sufficiency of God. "Vanity" is
literally "a breath," and would better be so rendered
in ver. 9, but for the recurrence of the verb from the
same root in ver. 10, which requires the rendering "be
not vain." It is desirable to preserve identity of translation,
so as to retain the play of words. But by doing
so ver. 9 is somewhat weakened. The eyes that have
been looking on God are cleared to see the shadowy
nothingness of men of all degrees. The differences of
high and low dwindle when seen from that "high
tower," as lower lands appear flat when viewed from a
mountain top. They are but "breath," so fleeting,
unsubstantial are they. They are a "lie," in so far
as hopes directed to them are deceived and trust misplaced.
The singer is not cynically proclaiming man's
worthlessness, but asserting his insufficiency as the
object of man's trust. His point of view is different
from that of Psalm xxxix., though his words are the
same. The "Only" which begins ver. 9 carries us
back to the similar beginning of the preceding strophes,
and brings out the true force of the following words, by
suggesting the contrast between men and the God on
whom the psalmist's soul waits in silence. That contrast
may be further continued in ver. 9 <i>b</i>. The lowly
and the lofty are in one scale. What is in the other,
the solid weight of which sends them aloft as lighter?
Is it pressing the metaphor too far to suppose that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
psalmist is weighing the whole mass of men against
God only? Heap them altogether and balance them
against Him, and the gathered mass does not weigh as
much as an imponderable breath. Who could trust in
that emptiness when he has God to trust in? Who
would grasp shadows when he may cling to that eternal
Substance?</p>

<p>The natural conclusion from ver. 9 follows in the
exhortation of ver. 10, which completes the positive
presentation of the true object of trust (ver. 8) by the
warning against false refuges. The introduction of
"oppression" and "robbery" is singular, for it can
scarcely be supposed that the assailants of the psalmist
are here addressed, and still less that his followers
needed to be warned against these crimes. Cheyne,
therefore, follows Graetz and others in reading "perverseness"
for "oppression," and "crookedness" for
"robbery"; but the alteration throws the clause out
of harmony with the next clause. It may be that in
ver. 10 <i>a</i> the psalmist has in view unjust gain and in <i>b</i>
justly acquired wealth, and that thus his two dehortations
cover the whole ground of material riches, as if
he had said, "Whether rightly or wrongly won, they are
wrongly used if they are trusted in." The folly and
misery of such trust are vigorously set forth by that
word "become vain." The curse of misplaced confidence
is that it brings down a man to the level of what
he trusts in, as the blessing of wisely placed trust is
that it lifts him to that level. Trust in vanity is vain,
and makes the truster "vanity." Wind is not a
nourishing diet. It may inflate, or, as Paul says about
knowledge, may "puff up," but not "build up." Men
are assimilated to the objects of their trust; and if these
are empty, "so is every one that trusteth in them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>So far the psalmist has spoken. But his silent
waiting has been rewarded with a clear voice from
heaven, confirming that of his faith. It is most natural
to regard the double revelation received by the psalmist
as repeated in the following proclamation of the two
great aspects of the Divine nature&mdash;Power and Loving-kindness.
The psalmist has learned that these two
are not opposed nor separate, but blend harmoniously
in God's nature, and are confluent in all His works.
Power is softened and directed by Loving-kindness.
Loving-kindness has as its instrument Omnipotence.
The synthesis of these two is in the God whom men are
invited to trust; and such trust can never be disappointed;
for His Power and His Loving-kindness will
co-operate to "render to a man according to his work."
The last word of the psalm adds the conception of
Righteousness to those of Power and Loving-kindness.
But the psalmist seems to have in view mainly one
direction in which that rendering "to a man according
to his work" is active&mdash;namely, in answering the trust
which turns away from human power which is weakness,
and from human love which may change and must die,
to anchor itself on the might and tenderness of God.
Such "work of faith" will not be in vain; for these
twin attributes of Power and Love are pledged to
requite it with security and peace.</p>

11  But the king shall rejoice in God,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Every one that swears by Him shall glory,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For the mouth of them that speak a lie shall be stopped.</span><br />
</p>


<p>If the psalmist is allowed to speak, he gives many
details of his circumstances in his song. He is in
a waterless and weary land, excluded from the sanctuary,
followed by enemies seeking his life. He expects a
fight, in which they are to fall by the sword, and apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
their defeat is to lead to his restoration to his
kingdom.</p>

<p>These characteristics converge on David. Cheyne
has endeavoured to show that they fit the faithful
Jews in the Maccabean period, and that the "king"
in ver. 2 is "Jonathan or [better] Simon" ("Orig. of
Psalt.," 99, and "Aids to Dev. Study of Crit.," 308 <i>seqq.</i>).
But unless we are prepared to accept the dictum that
"Pre-Jeremian such highly spiritual hymns obviously
cannot be" (<i>u.s.</i>), the balance of probability will be
heavily in favour of the Davidic origin.</p>

<p>The recurrence of the expression "My soul" in
vv. 1, 5, 8, suggests the divisions into which the psalm
falls. Following that clue, we recognise three parts,
in each of which a separate phase of the experience
of the soul in its communion with God is presented as
realised in sequence by the psalmist. The soul longs
and thirsts for God (vv. 1-4). The longing soul is
satisfied in God (vv. 5-7). The satisfied soul cleaves
to and presses after God (vv. 8-11). These stages melt
into each other in the psalm as in experience, but are
still discernible.</p>

<p>In the first strophe the psalmist gives expression
in immortal words to his longing after God. Like many
a sad singer before and after him, he finds in the dreary
scene around an image of yet drearier experiences
within. He sees his own mood reflected in the grey
monotony of the sterile desert, stretching waterless on
every side, and seamed with cracks, like mouths gaping
for the rain that does not come. He is weary and
thirsty; but a more agonising craving is in his spirit,
and wastes his flesh. As in the kindred Psalms
xlii., xliii., his separation from the sanctuary has dimmed
his sight of God. He longs for the return of that vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
in its former clearness. But even while he thirsts, he
in some measure possesses, since his resolve to "seek
earnestly" is based on the assurance that God is his
God. In the region of the devout life the paradox is true
that we long precisely because we have. Every soul
is athirst for God; but unless a man can say, "Thou
art my God," he knows not how to interpret nor where
to slake his thirst, and seeks, not after the living
Fountain of waters, but after muddy pools and broken
cisterns.</p>

<p>Ver. 2 is difficult principally because the reference of
the initial "So" is doubtful. By some it is connected
with the first clause of ver. 1: "So"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, as my God&mdash;"have
I seen Thee." Others suppose a comparison to
be made between the longing just expressed and former
ones, and the sense to be, "With the same eager desire
as now I feel in the desert have I gazed in the sanctuary."
This seems the better view. Hupfeld proposes to
transpose the two clauses, as the A.V. has done in its
rendering, and thus gets a smoother run of thought.
The immediate object of the psalmist's desire is thus
declared to be "to behold Thy power and glory," and
the "So" is substantially equivalent to "According as."
If we retain the textual order of the clauses, and understand
the first as paralleling the psalmist's desert longing
with that which he felt in the sanctuary, the second
clause will state the aim of the ardent gaze&mdash;namely, to
"behold Thy power and Thy glory." These attributes
were peculiarly manifested amid the imposing sanctities
where the light of the Shechinah, which was especially
designated as "the Glory," shone above the ark.</p>

<p>The first clause of ver. 3 is closely connected with
the preceding, and gives the reason for some part of
the emotion there expressed, as the introductory "For"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
shows. But it is a question to which part of the foregoing
verses it refers. It is probably best taken as
assigning the reason for their main subject&mdash;namely, the
psalmist's thirst after God. "Where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also." Our desires are shaped
by our judgments of what is good. The conviction of
God's transcendent excellence and absolute sufficiency
for all our cravings must precede the direction of these
to Him. Unless all enjoyments and possessions, which
become ours through our corporeal life, and that life
itself, are steadfastly discerned to be but a feather's
weight in comparison with the pure gold of God's loving-kindness,
we shall not long for it more than for them.</p>

<p>The deep desires of this psalmist were occasioned by
his seclusion from outward forms of worship, which
were to him so intimately related to the inward reality,
that he felt farther away from God in the wilderness
than when he caught glimpses of His face, through the
power and glory which he saw visibly manifested in
the sanctuary. But in his isolation he learns to equate
his desert yearnings with his sanctuary contemplations,
and thus glides from longing to fruition. His devotion,
nourished by forms, is seen in the psalm in the very
act of passing on to independence of form; and so
springs break out for him in the desert. His passion
of yearning after God rebukes and shames our faint
desires. This man's soul was all on the stretch to
grasp and hold God. His very physical frame was
affected by his intense longing. If he did not long too
much, most men, even those who thirst after God most,
long terribly too little. Strong desire has a joy in its
very aching; feeble desire only makes men restless and
uncomfortable. Nothing can be more preposterous
than tepid aspirations after the greatest and only good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
To hold as creed that God's loving-kindness is better
than life, and to wish a little to possess it, is surely
irrational, if anything is so.</p>

<p>The remaining clauses of ver. 3 and ver. 4 form a
transition to the full consciousness of satisfaction which
animates the psalmist in the second part. The resolve
to praise, and the assurance that he will have occasion
to praise, succeed his longing with startling swiftness.
The "So" of ver. 4 seems to be equivalent to "Accordingly"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
since Thy loving-kindness is such supreme
good, and is mine because I have desired it. Continual
praise and as continual invocation are the fitting employments
of those who receive it, and by these alone can
their possession of the loving-kindness bestowed be
made permanent. If empty palms are not ever lifted
towards God, His gifts will not descend. When these
are received, they will fall like morning sunbeams on
stony and dumb lips, which before were only parted to
let out sighs, and will draw forth music of praise.
There are longings which never are satisfied; but God
lets no soul that thirsts for Him perish for lack of the
water of life. Wisdom bids us fix our desires on that
Sovereign Good, to long for which is ennobling and
blessed, and to possess which is rest and the beginning
of heaven.</p>

<p>Thus the psalmist passes imperceptibly to the second
strophe, in which the longing soul becomes the satisfied
soul. The emblem of a feast is naturally suggested
by the previous metaphor of thirst. The same conviction,
which urged the psalmist forward in his search
after God, now assures him of absolute satisfaction
in finding Him. Since God's loving-kindness is better
than life, the soul that possesses Him can have no
unappeased cravings, nor any yet hungry affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
or wishes. In the region of communion with God,
fruition is contemporaneous with and proportioned
to desire. When the rain comes in the desert, what
was baked earth is soon rich pasture, and the dry
torrent beds, where the white stones glittered ghastly
in the sunshine, are musical with rushing streams and
fringed with budding oleanders. On that telegraph a
message is flashed upwards and an answer speeds
downwards, in a moment of time. Many of God's gifts
are delayed by Love; but the soul that truly desires
Him has never long to wait for a gift that equals its
desire.</p>

<p>When God is possessed, the soul is satisfied. So
entire is the correspondence between wants and gift,
that every concavity in us finds, as it were, a convexity
to match it in Him. The influx of the great ocean of
God fills every curve of the shore to the brim, and the
flashing glory of that sunlit sea covers the sands, and
brings life where stagnation reigned and rotted. So
the satisfied soul lives to praise, as the psalm goes on
to vow. Lips that drink such draughts of Loving-kindness
will not be slow to tell its sweetness. If we
have nothing to say about God's goodness, the probable
cause is our want of experience of it.</p>

<p>That feast leaves no bitter taste. The remembrance
of it is all but as sweet as its enjoyment was. Thus,
in ver. 6, the psalmist recounts how, in the silent hours
of night, when many joys are seen to be hollow, and
conscience wakes to condemn coarse delights, he recalled
his blessednesses in God, and, like a ruminant animal,
tasted their sweetness a second time. The verse is
best regarded as an independent sentence. So blessed
was the thought of God, that, if once it rose in his
wakeful mind as he lay on his bed, he "meditated"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
on it all the night. Hasty glances show little of anything
great. Nature does not unveil her beauty to a
cursory look; much less does God disclose His. If
we would feel the majesty of the heavens, we must gaze
long and steadfastly into their violet depths. The
mention of the "night-watches" is appropriate, if this
psalm is David's. He and his band of fugitives had to
keep vigilant guard as they lay down shelterless in the
desert; but even when thus ringed by possible perils,
and listening for the shout of nocturnal assailants, the
psalmist could recreate and calm his soul by meditation
on God. Nor did his experience of God's sufficiency
bring only remembrances; it kindled hopes. "For
Thou hast been a help for me; and in the shadow of
Thy wings will I shout for joy." Past deliverances
minister to present trust and assure of future joy. The
prerogative of the soul, blessed in the sense of possessing
God, is to discern in all that has been the manifestations
of His help, and to anticipate in all that is
to come the continuance of the same. Thus the second
strophe gathers up the experiences of the satisfied soul
as being fruition, praise, sweet lingering memories that
fill the night of darkness and fear, and settled trust in
the coming of a future which will be of a piece with
such a present and past.</p>

<p>The third strophe (vv. 8-11) presents a stage in
the devout soul's experience which naturally follows
the two preceding. Ver. 8 has a beautifully pregnant
expression for the attitude of the satisfied soul. Literally
rendered, the words run, "cleaves after Thee," thus
uniting the ideas of close contact and eager pursuit.
Such union, however impossible in the region of lower
aims, is the very characteristic of communion with God,
in which fruition subsists along with longing, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
God is infinite, and the closest approach to and fullest
possession of Him are capable of increase. Satisfaction
tends to become satiety when that which produces it
is a creature whose limits are soon reached; but the
cup which God gives to a thirsty soul has no cloying
in its sweetness. On the other hand, to seek after
Him has no pain nor unrest along with it, since the
desire for fuller possession comes from the felt joy
of present attainment. Thus, in constant interchange
satisfaction and desire beget each other, and each
carries with it some trace of the other's blessedness.</p>

<p>Another beautiful reciprocity is suggested by the
very order of the words in the two clauses of ver. 8.
The first ends with "Thee"; the second begins with
"Me." The mutual relation of God and the soul is
here set forth. He who "cleaves after God" is upheld
in his pursuit by God's hand. And not in his pursuit
only, but in all his life; for the condition of receiving
sustaining help is desire for it, directed to God and
verified by conduct. Whoever thus follows hard after
God will feel his outstretched, seeking hand inclosed
in a strong and loving palm, which will steady him
against assaults and protect him in dangers. "No
man is able to pluck them out of the Father's hand,"
if only they do not let it go. It may slip from slack
fingers.</p>

<p>We descend from the heights of mystic communion
in the remainder of the psalm. But in the singer's
mind his enemies were God's enemies, and, as ver. 11
shows, were regarded as apostates from God in being
traitors to "the king." They did not "swear by
Him"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, they did not acknowledge God as God.
Therefore, such being their character, the psalmist's
confidence that God's right hand upheld him necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
passes into assurance of their defeat. This is not
vindictiveness, but confidence in the sufficiency of
God's protection, and is perfectly accordant with the
lofty strains of the former part of the psalm. The picture
of the fate of the beaten foe is partly drawn from
that of Korah and his company. These rebels against
God's king shall go, where those rebels against His
priest long ago descended. "They shall be poured out
upon the hands of the sword," or, more literally still,
"They shall pour him out," is a vigorous metaphor,
incapable of transference into English, describing how
each single enemy is given over helplessly, as water
is poured out, to the sword, which is energetically
and to our taste violently, conceived of as a person
with hands. The meaning is plain&mdash;a battle is impending,
and the psalmist is sure that his enemies will
be slain, and their corpses torn by beasts of prey.</p>

<p>How can the "king's" rejoicing in God be the consequence
of their slaughter, unless they are rebels? And
what connection would the defeat of a rebellion have
with the rest of the psalm, unless the singer were
himself the king? "This one line devoted to the king
is strange," says Cheyne. The strangeness is unaccounted
for, but on the supposition that David is the
king and singer. If so, it is most natural that his song
should end with a note of triumph, and should anticipate
the joy of his own heart and the "glorying" of
his faithful followers, who had been true to God in
being loyal to His anointed.</p>

<p>Familiar notes are struck in this psalm, which
has no very distinctive features. Complaint of
secret slanderers, the comparison of their words to
arrows and swords, their concealed snares, their blasphemous
defiance of detection, the sudden flashing out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
of God's retribution, the lesson thereby read to and
learned by men, the vindication of God's justice, and
praise from all true hearts, are frequent themes. They
are woven here into a whole which much resembles
many other psalms. But the singer's heart is none
the less in his words because many others before him
have had to make like complaints and to stay themselves
on like confidence. "We have all of us one
human heart," and well-worn words come fresh to each
lip when the grip of sorrow is felt.</p>

<p>The division into pairs of verses is clear here. The
burdened psalmist begins with a cry for help, passes
on to dilate on the plots of his foes, turns swiftly from
these to confidence in God, which brings future deliverance
into present peril and sings of it as already
accomplished, and ends with the assurance that his
enemies' punishment will witness for God and gladden
the upright.</p>

<p>In the first pair of verses complaint is sublimed into
prayer, and so becomes strengthening instead of
weakening. He who can cry "Hear, O God, guard,
hide" has already been able to hide in a safe refuge.
"The terror caused by the enemy" is already dissipated
when the trembling heart grasps at God; and
escape from facts which warrant terror will come in
good time. This man knows himself to be in danger
of his life. There are secret gatherings of his enemies,
and he can almost hear their loud voices as they plan
his ruin. What can he do, in such circumstances, but
fling himself on God? No thought of resistance has
he. He can <i>but</i> pray, but he <i>can</i> pray; and no man
is helpless who can look up. However high and closely
engirdling may be the walls that men or sorrows build
around us, there is always an opening in the dungeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
roof, through which heaven is visible and prayers can
mount.</p>

<p>The next two pairs of verse (3-6) describe the
machinations of the enemies in language for the most
part familiar, but presenting some difficulties. The
metaphors of a slanderous tongue as a sword and
mischief-meaning words as arrows have occurred in
several other psalms (<i>e.g.</i>, lv. 21; lvii. 4; lix. 7). The
reference may either be to calumnies or to murderous
threats and plans. The latter is the more probable.
Secret plots are laid, which are suddenly unmasked.
From out of some covert of seeming friendship an
unlooked-for arrow whizzes. The archers "shoot, and
fear not." They are sure of remaining concealed, and
fear neither man's detection of them nor God's.</p>

<p>The same ideas are enlarged on in the third verse-pair
(5, 6) under a new metaphor. Instead of arrows
flying in secret, we have now snares laid to catch
unsuspecting prey. "They strengthen themselves [in]
an evil plan" (lit. <i>word</i>) pictures mutual encouragement
and fixed determination. They discuss the best
way of entrapping the psalmist, and, as in the preceding
verse, flatter themselves that their subtle schemes are
too well buried to be observed, whether by their victim
or by God. Ver. 6 tells without a figure the fact
meant in both figures. "They scheme villainies," and
plume themselves upon the cleverness of their unsuspected
plots. The second clause of the verse is obscure.
But the suppositions that in it the plotters speak as
in the last clause of the preceding verse, and that
"they say" or the like expression is omitted for the
sake of dramatic effect, remove much of the difficulty.
"We have schemed a well-schemed plan" is their
complacent estimate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>God's retribution scatters their dreams of impunity,
as the next pair of verses (7, 8) tells. The verbs are
in the past tense, though the events described are still
in the future; for the psalmist's faith reckons them to
be as good as done. They were shooting at him. God
will shoot at them. The archer becomes a target.
"With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to
you again." Punishment is moulded after the guise
of sin. The allusion to ver. 4 is made more obvious
by adopting a different division of ver. 7 from that
directed by the accents, and beginning the second
half with "Suddenly," as in ver. 4. Ver. 8 <i>b</i> is with
difficulty made intelligible with the existing reading.
Probably the best that can be done with it is to render
it as above, though it must be acknowledged that "their
tongue comes upon them" needs a good deal of explanation
to be made to mean that the consequences of
their sins of speech fall on them. The drift of the
clause must be that retribution falls on the offending
tongue; but there is probably some textual corruption
now unremovable. Cheyne wisely falls back on
asterisks. Whatever is the precise nature of the
instance of <i>lex talionis</i> in the clause, it is hailed with
gestures of scornful approval by all beholders. Many
men approve the Divine punishments, who have no
deep horror of the sins that are punished. There is
something of a noble, if rough, sense of justice in most
men, and something of an ignoble satisfaction in seeing
the downfall of the powerful, and both sentiments set
heads nodding approval of God's judgments.</p>

<p>The psalm closes with the familiar thought that
these judgments will move to wholesome awe and be
told from lip to lip, while they become to the righteous
occasion of joy, incitements to find refuge in God, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
material for triumph. These are large consequences
to flow from one man's deliverance. The anticipation
would be easily explained if we took the speaker to
be the personified nation. But it would be equally
intelligible if he were in any way a conspicuous or
representative person. The humblest may feel that
his experience of Divine deliverance witnesses, to as
many as know it, of a delivering God. That is a high
type of godliness which, like this psalmist, counts the
future as so certain that it can be spoken of as present
even in peril. It augurs a still higher to welcome
deliverance, not only for the ease it brings to the
suppliant, but for the glory it brings to God.</p>

<p>This and the two following psalms form a little
group, with one great thought dominant in each&mdash;namely,
that God's manifestations of grace and providence
to Israel are witnesses to the world. They
all reach out to "the ends of the earth" in yearning and
confidence that God's name will be adored there, and
they all regard His dealings with His people as His
appeals to mankind, which will not always be vain.
Psalm lxv. begins with that privilege of approach to
God with which Psalm lxvi. ends. In both, iniquity in
heart is regarded as hindering access to God; and, in
both, the psalmist's experience of answered prayer is
treated as testimony for the world of the blessedness of
worshipping Israel's God. This psalm falls into three
parts, which set forth a threefold revelation of God in
His acts. The first (vv. 1-4) deals with the most
intimate privileges of the men who dwell in His house.
The second (vv. 5-8) points to His rule in nature, the
tokens of God's power in the mighty things of creation&mdash;mountains,
ocean, day and night, the radiant east,
the solemn sunset-west. The third (vv. 9-13) gives
a lovely picture of the annual miracle which brings
harvest joys. The underlying thought binding these
three parts into unity seems to be the witness to God's
name which each set of His acts bears&mdash;a witness
which "they that dwell in the uttermost parts" hear
sounded in their ears. If this is the true view of the
psalm, we may hear a reminiscence of it in Paul's
remonstrance with the rude Lycaonian peasants: "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
left not Himself without witness, in that He did good,
and gave you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons,
filling your hearts with food and gladness."</p>

<p>The first strophe is wholly concerned with the glory
of God as answering prayer. It begins with enigmatical
words, which, if the existing text is adhered to, carry
a deep truth. There are two kinds of prayer&mdash;wordless
submission of will and spoken vows. The former is
truly praise. The same thought is found in Psalm lxii.
It goes down to the root of the matter. The true
notion of prayer is not that of swaying God's will to
gratify ours, but that of bringing ours into unremonstrating
acceptance of His. When the accents of eager
desire or of impatient murmuring and vain sobs and
weeping are hushed, the still soul enters into closeness
of communion, else unattainable. Beautiful and profoundly
true as this is, it is not indubitably the
psalmist's meaning; and there is much to be said for
the rendering which is adopted from the LXX. by many
commentators, and which only requires a slight change
in the vocalisation&mdash;namely, "Praise is meet for Thee."
But that idea is expressed in Psalm xxxiii. 1 by a
different word, and the meaning of the one used here
is not <i>to be suitable for</i>, but <i>to be like</i>. So that we have
to choose between altering the text and then imposing
a somewhat unusual meaning on the word gained, and
adhering to the present reading and gaining a meaning
which is admitted to be "fine" but alleged to be
"unbiblical." On the whole, that meaning seems
preferable. The convictions that God accepts silent
devotion and answers vows, so that the thank-offering
promised in trouble will be called for by deliverance,
"fill the psalmist with a longing that all mankind may
have recourse to the same Divine Friend" (Cheyne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
<i>in loc.</i>). His experience of accepted prayers has taught
him that it is God's nature and property to be "the
hearer of prayer" (the word is a participle, expressive
of a permanent characteristic), and therefore he is sure
that "all flesh," in its weariness and need of an ear
into which to pour necessities and sorrows, will come
to Him. His eye travels far beyond Israel, and contemplates
mankind as coming to worship. But one
black barrier rises between men and God, the separating
power of which the singer has painfully felt. Sin
chokes the stream that would flow from seeking hearts
into the ocean of God. The very act of gathering
himself up to pray and praise quickens the sense of
sinfulness in the psalmist. Therefore his look turns
swiftly inwards, for the only time in the psalm. The
consciousness of transgression wakes the sense of
personality and isolation as nothing else will, and for
one bitter moment the singer is, as it were, prisoned in
the awful solitude of individual responsibility. His
words reflect his vivid sight of his sins in their
manifoldness, for he says that "matters of iniquities"
have overcome him. The exuberant expression is not
tautological, but emotional. And then he passes into
sunshine again, and finds that, though he had to be
alone in guilt, he is one of a company in the experience
of forgiveness. Emphatically he reduplicates "Thou"
in his burst of confidence in God's covering of sins; for
none but God can cope with the evil things that are too
strong for man. I can neither keep them out, nor drive
them out when they have come in, nor cleanse the
stains that their hoofs have made; but Thou, Thou
canst and dost cover them. Is not that an additional
reason for "all flesh" coming to God, and almost a
guarantee that they will?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>The strophe ends with an exclamation celebrating
the blessedness of dwelling with God. That refers,
no doubt, to Israel's prerogative of access to the
Temple; but the inward and outward are blended, as
in many places in the Psalter where dwelling in the
house of the Lord is yearned for or rejoiced in. The
universalism of the psalm does not forget the special
place held by the nation whom God "has chosen and
brought near." But the reality beneath the symbol
is too familiar and sweet to this singer for him to
suppose that mere outward access exhausts the possibilities
of blessed communion. It is no violent forcing
more into his words than they contain, if we read in
them deeply spiritual truths. It is noteworthy that
they follow the reference to forgiveness, and, when
taken in conjunction therewith, may be called an
itinerary of the road to God. First comes forgiveness
by expiation, for such is the meaning of "covering,"
Then the cleansed soul has "access with confidence";
then approaching, it happily dwells a guest in the house,
and is supplied with that which satisfies all desires.
The guest's security in the house of his host, his right
to protection, help, and food, are, as usual, implied in
the imagery. The prerogative of his nation, which the
psalmist had in mind, is itself imagery, and the reality
which it shadowed is that close abiding in God which
is possible by faith, love, communion of spirit, and
obedience of life, and which, wherever realised, keeps
a soul in a great calm, whatever tempests rave, and
satisfies its truest needs and deepest longings, whatever
famine may afflict the outward life. Forgiven men
may dwell with God. They who do are blessed.</p>

<p>The second strophe (vv. 5-8) celebrates another
aspect of God's manifestation by deeds, which has, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
like manner, a message for the ends of the earth.
Israel is again the immediate recipient of God's acts,
but they reverberate through the world. Therefore
in ver. 5 the two clauses are not merely adjacent, but
connected. It is because God is ever revealing Himself
to the nation (for the tense of the verb "answer"
expresses continuous action) that He is revealed as the
trust of the whole earth. God's grace fructifies through
Israel to all. How clearly the psalmist had grasped the
truth that God has limited the knowledge of Himself
to one spot of earth in order to its universal diffusion!</p>

<p>The light is focussed and set in a tower that it may
shine out over sea and storm. The fire is gathered
into a brasier that it may warm all the house. Some
commentators take that strong expression "the trust
of all the ends of the earth" as asserting that even
the confidences of idolaters in their gods are at bottom
trust in Jehovah and find their way to Him. But such
a view of idolatry is foreign to the Old Testament,
and is not needed to explain the psalmist's words.
God is the only worthy object of trust, and remains so
whether men do in fact trust Him or not. And one
day, thinks the psalmist, God's patient manifestation
of His grace to Israel will tell, and all men will come
to know Him for what He is. "The remotest sea" is
not translation, but paraphrase. The psalmist speaks in
vague terms, as one who knew not what lay beyond the
horizon of that little-traversed western ocean. Literally
his words are "the sea of the remote [peoples]"; but
a possible emendation has been suggested, reading
instead of <i>sea</i> "regions" or "nations." The change is
slight, and smooths an awkward expression, but destroys
the antithesis of earth and sea, and makes the second
clause a somewhat weak repetition of the first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>From the self-revelation of God in history the psalm
passes to His mighty deeds in nature (vv. 6, 7 <i>a</i>), and
from these it returns to His providential guidance of
human affairs (ver. 7 <i>b</i>). The two specimens of Divine
power celebrated in vv. 6, 7, are suggested by the
closing words of ver. 5. "The ends of the earth" were,
according to ancient cosmography, girdled by mountains;
and God has set these fast. The dash of "the
remotest seas" is hushed by Him. Two mighty things
are selected to witness to the Mightier who made and
manages them. The firm bulk of the mountains is firm
because He is strong. The tossing waves are still
because He bids them be silent. How transcendently
great then is He, and how blind those who, seeing hill
and ocean, do not see God! The mention of the sea,
the standing emblem of unrest and rebellious power,
suggests the "tumult of the peoples," on which similar
repressive power is exercised. The great deeds of God,
putting down tyranny and opposition to Israel, which
is rebellion against Himself, strike terror, which is
wholesome and is purified into reverence, into the
distant lands; and so, from the place where the sun
rises to the "sad-coloured end of evening" where it
sinks in the west, <i>i.e.</i>, through all the earth, there rings
out a shout of joy. Such glowing anticipations of
universal results from the deeds of God, especially for
Israel, are the products of diseased national vanity,
unless they are God-taught apprehension of the Divine
purpose of Israel's history, which shall one day be
fulfilled, when the knowledge of the yet more wondrous
deeds which culminated in the Cross is spread to the
ends of the earth and the remotest seas.</p>

<p>God reveals Himself not only in the sanctities of His
house, nor in His dread "signs" in nature and history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
but in the yearly recurring harvest, which was waving,
as yet unreaped, while the poet sang. The local
colouring which regards rain as the chief factor in
fertility and the special gift of God is noticeable. In
such a land as Palestine, irrigation seems the one thing
needful to turn desert into fruitful field. To "water"
the soil is there emphatically to "enrich" it. The
psalmist uses for "river" the technical word for an
irrigation cutting, as if he would represent God in
the guise of the cultivator, who digs his ditches that
the sparkling blessing may reach all his field. But
what a difference between men-made watercourses and
God's! The former are sometimes flooded, but often
dry; His are full of water. The prose of the figure is,
of course, abundant rain. It prepares the earth for the
seed, and "so" in effect prepares the corn. The one
is the immediate, the other the ultimate issue and
purpose. Spring showers prepare autumn fruits. It
is so in all regions of man's endeavour and of God's
work; and it is practical wisdom to train ourselves to
see the assurance of the end in His means, and to be
confident that whatever His doings have a manifest
tendency to effect shall one day be ripened and
harvested. How lovingly and patiently the psalm
represents the Divine Husbandman as attending to all
the steps of the process needed for the great ingathering!
He guides the showers, He fills the little valleys of the
furrows, and smooths down the tiny hills of the intervening
ridges. He takes charge of the germinating
seed, and His sunshine smiles a benediction on the
tender green blade, as it pricks through the earth which
has been made soft enough for it to pierce from beneath.
This unhesitating recognition of the direct action of
God in all "natural" processes is the true point of view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
from which to regard them. God is the only force;
and His immediate action is present in all material
changes. The Bible knows nothing of self-moving
powers in nature, and the deepest conception of God's
relations to things sensible knows as little. "There is
no power but of God" is the last word of religion and
of true philosophy.</p>

<p>The poet stands in the joyous time when all the
beauty of summer flushes the earth, and the harvest is
yet a hope, not a possibly disappointing reality. It is
near enough to fill his song with exultation. It is far
enough off to let him look on the whitened fields, and
not on the bristly stubble. So he regards the "crown"
as already set on a year of goodness. He sees God's
chariot passing in triumph and blessing over the land,
and leaving abundance wherever its wheel-tracks go.
Out in the uncultivated prairie, where sweet grass
unsown by man grows, is the flush of greenery, where,
before the rain, was baked and gaping earth. The hills,
that wear a girdle of forest trees half-way up towards
their barren summits, wave their foliage, as if glad.
The white fleeces of flocks are dotted over the vivid
verdure of every meadow, and one cannot see the
ground for the tall corn that stands waiting for the
sickle, in each fertile plain. The psalmist hears a hymn
of glad praise rising from all these happy and sunny
things; and for its melody he hushes his own, that he
and we may listen to</p>

</p>


<p>The most striking feature of this psalm is the
transition from the plural "we" and "our," in
vv. 1-12, to the singular "I" and "my," in vv. 13-20.
Ewald supposes that two independent psalms have
been united, but ver. 12 is as abrupt for an ending as
ver. 13 is for a beginning; and the "Come, hear," of
ver. 16 echoes the "Come, and see," of ver. 5. It is
possible that "the 'I' of the second part is identical with
the 'we' of the first; in other words, that the personified
community speaks here" (Baethgen); but the supposition
that the psalm was meant for public worship, and
is composed of a choral and a solo part, accounts for
the change of number. Such expressions as "my
soul" and "my heart" favour the individual reference.
Of course, the deliverance magnified by the single
voice is the same as that celebrated by the loud acclaim
of many tongues; but there is a different note in the
praise of the former&mdash;there is a tone of inwardness in
it, befitting individual appropriation of general blessings.
To this highest point, that of the action of the single
soul in taking the deliverances of the community for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
its very own, and pouring out its own praise, the
psalm steadily climbs. It begins with the widest outlook
over "all the earth," summoned to ring forth
joyous praise. It ends focussed to one burning point,
in a heart fired by the thought that God "has not
turned away his loving-kindness from <i>me</i>." So we
learn how each single soul has to claim its several part
in world-wide blessings, as each flower-calyx absorbs
the sunshine that floods the pastures.</p>

<p>The psalm has no superscription of date or author,
and no clue in its language to the particular deliverance
that called it forth. The usual variety of conjectures
have been hazarded. The defeat of Sennacherib
occurs to some; the return from Babylon to others;
the Maccabean period to yet another school of critics.
It belongs to a period when Israel's world-significance
and mission were recognised (which Cheyne considers
a post-exilic feature, "Orig. of Psalt.," 176), and when
the sacrificial worship was in full force; but beyond
these there are no clear data for period of composition.</p>

<p>It is divided into five strophes, three of which are
marked by Selah. That musical indication is wanting
at the close of the third strophe (ver. 12), which is
also the close of the first or choral part, and its absence
may be connected with the transition to a single voice.
A certain progress in thought is noticeable, as will
appear as we proceed. The first strophe calls upon
all the earth to praise God for His works. The special
deeds which fire the psalmist are not yet mentioned,
though they are present to his mind. The summons
of the world to praise passes over into prophecy that
it shall praise. The manifestation of God's character
by act will win homage. The great thought that God
has but to be truly known in order to be reverenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
is an axiom with this psalmist; and no less certain is
he that such knowledge and such praise will one day
fill the world. True, he discerns that submission will
not always be genuine; for he uses the same word to
express it as occurs in Psalm xviii. 44, which represents
"feigned homage." Every great religious awakening has
a fringe of adherents, imperfectly affected by it, whose
professions outrun reality, though they themselves
are but half conscious that they feign. But though
this sobering estimate of the shallowness of a widely
diffused recognition of God tones down the psalmist's
expectations, and has been abundantly confirmed by
later experience, his great hope remains as an early
utterance of the conviction, which has gathered assurance
and definiteness by subsequent Revelation, and is
now familiar to all. The world is God's. His Self-revelation
will win hearts. There shall be true submission
and joyous praise, girdling the earth as it rolls.
The psalmist dwells mainly on the majestic and awe-inspiring
aspect of God's acts. His greatness of power
bears down opposition. But the later strophes introduce
other elements of the Divine nature and syllables of
the Name, though the inmost secret of the "power
of God" in the weakness of manhood and the all-conquering
might of Love is not yet ripe for utterance.</p>

<p>The second strophe advances to a closer contemplation
of the deeds of God, which the nations are
summoned to behold. He is not only "dread" in His
doings towards mankind at large, but Israel's history
is radiant with the manifestation of His name, and
that past lives on, so that ancient experiences give the
measure and manner of to-day's working. The retrospect
embraces the two standing instances of God's
delivering help&mdash;the passage of the Red Sea and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Jordan&mdash;and these are not dead deeds in a far-off
century. For the singer calls on his own generation
to rejoice "there" in Him. Ver. 6 <i>c</i> is by some translated
as "There did we rejoice," and more accurately
by others, "Let us rejoice." In the former case the
essential solidarity of all generations of the nation is
most vividly set forth. But the same idea is involved
in the correct rendering, according to which the men
of the psalmist's period are entitled and invoked to
associate themselves in thought with that long-past
generation, and to share in their joy, since they do
possess the same power which wrought then. God's
work is never antiquated. It is all a revelation of
eternal activities. What He has been, He is. What
He did, He does. Therefore faith may feed on all
the records of old time, and expect the repetition of all
that they contain. Such an application of history to
the present makes the nerve of this strophe. For
ver. 7, following on the retrospect, declares the perpetuity
of God's rule, and that His eyes still keep an
outlook, as a watchman on a tower might do, to mark
the enemies' designs, in order that He may intervene, as
of old, for His people's deliverance. He "looked forth
upon the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of
cloud" (Exod. xiv. 24). Thus He still marks the
actions and plans of Israel's foes. Therefore it were
wise for the "rebellious" not to rear their heads so
high in opposition.</p>

<p>The third strophe comes still closer to the particular
deliverance underlying the psalm. Why should all
"peoples" be called upon to praise God for it? The
psalmist has learned that Israel's history is meant to
teach the world what God is, and how blessed it
is to dwell under His wing. No exclusiveness taints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
his enjoyment of special national privileges. He has
reached a height far above the conceptions of the rest
of the world in his day, and even in this day, except
where the Christian conception of "humanity" has
been heartily accepted. Whence came this width of
view, this purifying from particularism, this anticipation
by so many centuries of a thought imperfectly
realised even now? Surely a man who in those days
and with that environment could soar so high must
have been lifted by something mightier than his own
spirit. The details of the Divine dealings described
in the strophe are of small consequence in comparison
with its fixed expectation of the world's participation
in Israel's blessings. The familiar figures for affliction
reappear&mdash;namely, proving and refining in a furnace.
A less common metaphor is that of being prisoned in
a <i>dungeon</i>, as the word rendered "net" in the A.V. and
R.V. probably means. Another peculiar image is that of
ver. 12: "Thou hast caused men to ride over our head."
The word for "men" here connotes feebleness and
frailty, characteristics which make tyranny more intolerable;
and the somewhat harsh metaphor is best
explained as setting forth insolent and crushing domination,
whether the picture intended is that of ruthless
conquerors driving their chariots over their prone
victims, or that of their sitting as an incubus on their
shoulders and making them like beasts of burden. Fire
and water are standing figures for affliction. With
great force these accumulated symbols of oppression are
confronted by one abrupt clause ending the strophe,
and describing in a breath the perfect deliverance
which sweeps them all away: "Thou broughtest us
out into abundance." There is no need for the textual
alteration of the last word into "a wide place" (Hupfeld),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
a place of liberty (Cheyne), or freedom (Baethgen).
The word in the received text is that employed in
Psalm xxiii. 5. "My cup is <i>overfulness</i>" and "abundance"
yields a satisfactory meaning here, though not
closely corresponding to any of the preceding metaphors
for affliction.</p>

<p>The fourth strophe (vv. 13-15) begins the solo part.
It clothes in a garb appropriate to a sacrificial system
the thought expressed in more spiritual dress in the
next strophe, that God's deliverance should evoke men's
praise. The abundance and variety of sacrifices named,
and the fact that "rams" were not used for the offerings
of individuals, seem to suggest that the speaker
is, in some sense, representing the nation, and it has
been supposed that he may be the high priest. But
this is merely conjecture, and the explanation may be
that there is a certain ideal and poetical tone over the
representation, which does not confine itself to scrupulous
accuracy.</p>

<p>The last strophe (vv. 16-20) passes beyond sacrificial
symbols, and gives the purest utterance to the
emotions and resolves which ought to well up in
a devout soul on occasion of God's goodness. Not
only does the psalmist teach us how each individual
must take the general blessing for his very own&mdash;of
which act the faith which takes the world's Christ for
my Christ is the supreme example&mdash;but he teaches us
that the obligation laid on all recipients of God's mercy
is to tell it forth, and that the impulse is as certain to
follow real reception as the command is imperative.
Just as Israel received deliverances that the whole earth
might learn how strong and gracious was Israel's God,
we receive His blessings, and chiefly His highest gift of
life in Christ, not only that we may live, but that, living,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
we may "declare the works of the Lord." He has little
possession of God's grace who has not felt the necessity
of speech, and the impossibility of the lips being
locked when the heart is full.</p>

<p>The psalmist tells his experience of God's answers
to his prayer in a very striking fashion. Ver. 17 says
that he cried to God; and while his uttered voice was
supplication, the song extolling God for the deliverance
asked was, as it were, lying under his tongue, ready to
break forth,&mdash;so sure was he that his cry would be
heard. That is a strong faith which prepares banners
and music for the triumph before the battle is fought.
It would be presumptuous folly, not faith, if it rested
on anything less certain than God's power and will.</p>

<p>"I find David making a syllogism in mood and
figure.... 'If I regard iniquity in my heart, the
Lord will not hear me: but verily God hath heard
me; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.'
Now, I expected that David would have concluded thus:
'Therefore I regard not wickedness in my heart. But
far otherwise he concludes: 'Blessed be God, who
hath not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from
me.' Thus David hath deceived but not wronged me.
I looked that he should have clapped the crown on
his own, and he puts it on God's head. I will learn
this excellent logic." So says Fuller ("Good Thoughts
in Bad Times," p. 34, Pickering's ed., 1841). No
doubt, however, the psalmist means to suggest, though
he does not state, that his prayer was sincere. There
is no self-complacent attribution of merit to his supplication,
in the profession that it was untainted by any
secret, sidelong looking towards evil; and Fuller is
right in emphasising the suppression of the statement.
But even the appearance of such is avoided by the jet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
of praise which closes the psalm. Its condensed brevity
has induced some critics to mend it by expansion, as
they regard it as incongruous to speak of turning away
a man's prayer from himself. Some would therefore
insert "from Him" after "my prayer," and others
would expand still further by inserting an appropriate
negative before "His loving-kindness." But the slight
incongruity does not obscure the sense, and brings out
strongly the flow of thought. So fully does the psalmist
feel the connection between God's loving-kindness and
his own prayer, that these are, as it were, smelted into
one in his mind, and the latter is so far predominant
in his thoughts that he is unconscious of the anomaly
of his expression. To expand only weakens the swing
of the words and the power of the thought. It is
possible to tame lyric outbursts into accuracy at the
cost of energy. Psalmists are not bound to be correct
in style. Rivers wind; canals are straight.</p>

</p>


<p>This little psalm condenses the dominant thought
of the two preceding into a series of aspirations
after Israel's blessing, and the consequent diffusion of
the knowledge of God's way among all lands. Like
Psalm lxv., it sees in abundant harvests a type and
witness of God's kindness. But, whereas in Psalm lxv.
the fields were covered with corn, here the increase has
been gathered in. The two psalms may or may not be
connected in date of composition as closely as these
two stages of one harvest-time.</p>

<p>The structure of the psalm has been variously conceived.
Clearly the Selahs do not guide as to divisions
in the flow of thought. But it may be noted that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
seven verses in the psalm have each two clauses, with
the exception of the middle one (ver. 4), which has
three. Its place and its abnormal length mark it as the
core, round which, as it were, the whole is built up.
Further, it is as if encased in two verses (vv. 3, 5),
which, in their four clauses, are a fourfold repetition
of a single aspiration. These three verses are the
heart of the psalm&mdash;the desire that all the earth may
praise God, whose providence blesses it all. They are
again enclosed in two strophes of two verses each
(vv. 1, 2, and 6, 7), which, like the closer wrapping
round the core, are substantially parallel, and, unlike
it, regard God's manifestation to Israel as His great
witness to the world. Thus, working outwards from
the central verse, we have symmetry of structure, and
intelligible progress and distinctness of thought.</p>

<p>Another point of difficulty is the rendering of the
series of verbs in the psalm. Commentators are
unanimous in taking those of ver. 1 as expressions of
desire; but they bewilderingly diverge in their treatment
of the following ones. Details of the divergent
interpretations, or discussions of their reasons, cannot
be entered on here. It may be sufficient to say that
the adherence throughout to the optative rendering,
admitted by all in ver. 1, gives a consistent colouring
to the whole. It is arbitrary to vary the renderings in
so short a psalm. But, as is often the case, the aspirations
are so sure of their correspondence with the
Divine purpose that they tremble on the verge of being
prophecies, as, indeed, all wishes that go out along the
line of God's "way" are. Every deep, God-inspired
longing whispers to its utterer assurance that so it
shall be; and therefore such desires have ever in them
an element of fruition, and know nothing of the pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
of earthly wishes. They who stretch out empty hands
to God never "gather dust and chaff."</p>

<p>The priestly blessing (Numb. vi. 24-26) moulds ver. 1,
but with the substitution of <i>God</i> for <i>Jehovah</i>, and of
"among us" for "upon us." The latter variation gives
an impression of closer contact of men with the lustre of
that Divine Light, and of yet greater condescension in
God. The soul's longing is not satisfied by even the
fullest beams of a Light that is fixed on high; it dares
to wish for the stooping of the Sun to dwell among us.
The singer speaks in the name of the nation; and, by
using the priestly formula, claims for the whole people
the sacerdotal dignity which belonged to it by its
original constitution. He gives that idea its widest
extension. Israel is the world's high priest, lifting up
intercessions and holy hands of benediction for mankind.
What self-effacement, and what profound insight into
and sympathy with the mind of God breathe in that
collocation of desires, in which the gracious lustre of
God's face shining on us is longed for, chiefly that
thence it may be reflected into the dark places of earth,
to gladden sad and seeking eyes! This psalmist did
not know in how true a sense the Light would come
to dwell among men of Israel's race, and thence to
flood the world; but his yearning is a foreshadowing of
the spirit of Christianity, which forbids self-regarding
monopoly of its blessings. If a man is "light in the
Lord," he cannot but shine. "God hath shined into our
hearts, that we may give the light of the knowledge of
the glory of God." A Church illuminated with a manifestly
Divine light is the best witness for God. Eyes
which cannot look on the Sun may gaze at the clouds,
which tone down its colourless radiance into purple
and gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>The central core of the psalm may either be taken
as summons to the nations or as expression of desire
for them. The depth of the longing or the stringency
of the summons is wonderfully given by that fourfold
repetition of the same words in vv. 3 and 5, with the
emphatic "all of them" in the second clause of each.
Not less significant is the use of three names for the
aggregations of men&mdash;nations (ver. 2), peoples, and
tribes. All are included, whatever bond knits them in
communities, whatever their societies call themselves,
however many they are. The very vagueness gives
sublimity and universality. We can fill the vast outline
drawn by these sweeping strokes; and wider
knowledge should not be attended with narrowed
desires, nor feebler confidence that the Light shall
lighten every land. It is noticeable that in this central
portion the deeds of God among the nations are set
forth as the ground of their praise and joy in Him.
Israel had the light of His face, and that would draw
men to Him. But all peoples have the strength of
His arm to be their defender, and the guidance of His
hand by providences and in other ways unrecognised
by them. The "judgments" here contemplated are,
of course, not retribution for evil, but the aggregate of
dealings by which God shows His sovereignty in all
the earth. The psalmist does not believe that God's
goodness has been confined to Israel, nor that the rest
of the world has been left orphaned. He agrees with
Paul, "That which may be known of God is manifest
in them, for God manifested it to them."</p>

<p>The final strophe (vv. 6, 7) is substantially a repetition
of vv. 1, 2, with the addition that a past fact is
laid as the foundation of the desires or hopes of future
blessings. "The earth has yielded her increase."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
This may show that the psalm is a harvest hymn, but
it does not necessarily imply this. The thought may
have been born at any time. The singer takes the
plain fact that, year by year, by mysterious quickening
which he recognises as of God, the fertile earth "causes
the things sown in it to bring forth and bud," as an
evidence of Divine care and kindliness, which warrants
the desire and the confidence that all blessings will be
given. It seems a large inference from such a premise;
but it is legitimate for those who recognise God as
working in nature, and have eyes to read the parables
amid which we live. The psalmist reminds God of
His own acts, and, further, of His own name, and
builds on these his petitions and his faith. Because
He is "our God" He will bless us; and since the earth
has, by His gift, "yielded her increase," He will give
the better food which souls need. This the singer
desires, not only because he and his brethren need it,
but because a happy people are the best witnesses for
a good King, and worshippers "satisfied with favour
and full of the blessing of the Lord" proclaim most
persuasively, "Taste, and see that God is good." This
psalm is a truly missionary psalm, in its clear anticipation
of the universal spread of the knowledge of God,
in its firm grasp of the thought that the Church has
its blessings in order to the evangelisation of the world,
and in its intensity of longing that from all the ends of
the earth a shout of praise may go up to the God who
has sent some rays of His light into them all, and committed
to His people the task of carrying a brighter
illumination to every land.</p>

<p>This superb hymn is unsurpassed, if not unequalled,
in grandeur, lyric fire, and sustained rush of
triumphant praise. It celebrates a victory; but it is
the victory of the God who enters as a conqueror into
His sanctuary. To that entrance (vv. 15-18) all the
preceding part of the psalm leads up; and from it all
the subsequent part flows down. The Exodus is recalled
as the progress of a king at the head of his hosts,
and old pæans re-echo. That dwelling of God in the
sanctuary is "for ever." Therefore in the second part
of the psalm (vv. 19-35) its consequences for the
psalmist's generation and for the future are developed&mdash;Israel's
deliverance, the conquest of the nations, and
finally the universal recognition of God's sovereignty
and ringing songs sent up to Him.</p>

<p>The Davidic authorship is set aside as impossible
by most recent commentators, and there is much in
the psalm which goes against it; but, on the other
hand, the Syro-Ammonite war (2 Sam. xi.), in which
the ark was taken into the field, is not unnaturally
supposed by Delitzsch and others to explain the
special reference to the entrance of God into the
sanctuary. The numerous quotations and allusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
are urged as evidence of late date, especially the
undeniable resemblance with Isaiah II. But the
difficulty of settling which of two similar passages is
original and which copy is great; and if by one critical
canon such allusions are marks of lateness, by another,
rugged obscurities, such as those with which this psalm
bristles, are evidences of an early date.</p>

<p>The mention of only four tribes in ver. 27 is
claimed as showing that the psalm was written when
Judæa and Galilee were the only orthodox districts, and
central Palestine was in the hands of the Samaritans.
But could there be any talk of "princes of Zebulun
and Naphtali" then? The exultant tone of the
psalm makes its ascription to such a date as the age of
the Ptolemies unlikely, when "Israel is too feeble, too
depressed, to dream of self-defence; and, if God does
not soon interpose, will be torn to pieces" (Cheyne,
"Aids to the Devout Study," etc., 335).</p>

<p>To the present writer it does not appear that the
understanding and enjoyment of this grand psalm
depend so much on success in dating it as is supposed.
It may be post-exilic. Whoever fused its reminiscences
of ancient triumph into such a glowing outburst of
exultant faith, his vision of the throned God and his
conviction that ancient facts reveal eternal truths
remain for all generations as an encouragement of trust
and a prophecy of God's universal dominion.</p>

<p>The main division at ver. 18 parts the psalm into
two equal halves, which are again easily subdivided
into strophes.</p>

<p>The first strophe (vv. 1-6) may be regarded as
introductory to the chief theme of the first half&mdash;namely,
the triumphant march of the conquering God to His
sanctuary. It consists of invocation to Him to arise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
and of summons to His people to prepare His way and
to meet Him with ringing gladness. The ground of
both invocation and summons is laid in an expansion of
the meaning of His name as Helper of the helpless,
Deliverer of the captive, righteous, and plentifully
rewarding the proud doer. The invocation echoes the
Mosaic prayer "when the ark set forward" (Numb.
x. 35), with the alteration of the tense of the verb
from a simple imperative into a precative future, and of
"Jehovah" into God. This is the first of the quotations
characteristic of the psalm, which is penetrated
throughout with the idea that the deeds of the past are
revelations of permanent relations and activities. The
ancient history glows with present life. Whatever
God has done He is doing still. No age of the Church
needs to look back wistfully to any former, and say,
"Where be all His wondrous works which our fathers
have told us of?" The twofold conditions of God's
intervention are, as this strophe teaches, Israel's cry to
Him to arise, and expectant diligence in preparing His
way. The invocation, which is half of Israel's means
of insuring His coming, being a quotation, the summons
to perform the other half is naturally regarded by the
defenders of the post-exilic authorship as borrowed
from Isaiah II. (<i>e.g.</i>, xl. 3, lvii. 14, lxii. 10), while the
supporters of an earlier date regard the psalm as the
primary passage from which the prophet has drawn.</p>

<p>God "arises" when He displays by some signal act
His care for His people. That strong anthropomorphism
sets forth the plain truth that there come crises in
history, when causes, long silently working, suddenly
produce their world-shaking effects. God has seemed
to sit passive; but the heavens open, and all but blind
eyes can see Him, standing ready to smite that He may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
deliver. When He rises to His feet; the enemy scatters
in panic. His presence revealed is enough. The
emphatic repetition of "before" in these verses is
striking, especially when fully rendered,&mdash;from His
face (ver. 1); from the face of the fire (ver. 2); from
the face of God (ver. 2); before His face (vv. 3, 4).
To His foes that face is dreadful, and they would fain
cower away from its light; His friends sun themselves
in its brightness. The same fire consumes and vivifies.
All depends on the character of the recipients. In the
psalm "the righteous" are Israel, the ideal nation; the
"wicked" are its heathen foes; but the principle underlying
the fervid words demands a real assimilation of
moral character to the Divine, as a condition of being
at ease in the Light.</p>

<p>The "deserts" are, in consonance with the immediately
following reminiscences, those of the Exodus.
Hupfeld and those who discover in the psalm the hopes
of the captives in Babylon, take them to be the waste
wilderness stretching between Babylon and Palestine.
But it is better to see in them simply a type drawn
from the past, of guidance through any needs or
miseries. Vv. 5, 6, draw out at length the blessed
significance of the name Jah, in order to hearten to
earnest desire and expectance of Him. They are best
taken as in apposition with "Him" in ver. 4. Well
may we exult before Him who is the orphans' father,
the widows' advocate. There may be significance in
the contrast between what He is "in His holy habitation"
and when He arises to ride through the deserts.
Even in the times when he seems to be far above,
dwelling in the separation of His unapproachable
holiness, He is still caring and acting for the sad and
helpless. But when He comes forth, it is to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
solitary to dwell in a home, to bring out prisoners into
prosperity. Are these simply expressions for God's
general care of the afflicted, like the former clauses, or
do they point back to the Exodus? A very slight
change in the text gives the reading, "Makes the
solitary to return home"; but even without that alteration,
the last clause of the verse is so obviously an
allusion to the disobedient, "whose carcasses fell in the
wilderness," that the whole verse is best regarded as
pointing back to that time. The "home" to which the
people were led is the same as the "prosperity" into
which the prisoners are brought&mdash;namely, the rest and
well-being of Canaan; while the fate of the "rebellious"
is, as it ever is, to live and die amidst the drought-stricken
barrenness which they have chosen.</p>

<p>With the second strophe (vv. 7-10) begins the historical
retrospect, which is continued till, at the end of
the fourth (ver. 18), God is enthroned in the sanctuary,
there to dwell for ever. In the second strophe the
wilderness life is described. The third (vv. 11-14) tells
of the victories which won the land. The fourth
triumphantly contrasts the glory of the mountain where
God at last has come to dwell, with the loftier peaks
across the Jordan on which no such lustre gleams.</p>

<p>Vv. 7, 8, are from Deborah's song, with slight
omissions and alterations, notably of "Jehovah" into
"God." The phrase "before" still rings in the psalmist's
ears, and he changes Deborah's words, in the first clause
of ver. 7, so as to give the picture of God marching
in front of His people, instead of, as the older song
represented Him, coming from the east, to meet them
marching from the west. The majestic theophany at
the giving of the Law is taken as the culmination of
His manifestations in the wilderness. Vv. 9, 10, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
capable of two applications. According to one, they
anticipate the chronological order, and refer to the
fertility of the land, and the abundance enjoyed by
Israel when established there. According to the other,
they refer to the sustenance of the people in the wilderness.
The former view has in its favour the ordinary
use of "inheritance" for the land, the likelihood that
"rain" should be represented as falling on soil rather
than on people, and the apparent reference in "dwelt
therein," to the settlement in Canaan. The objection
to it is that reference to peaceful dwelling in the
land is out of place, since the next strophe pictures
the conquest. If, then, the verses belong to the
age of wandering, to what do they refer? Hupfeld
tries to explain the "rain" as meaning the manna,
and, still more improbably, takes the somewhat enigmatical
"assembly" of ver. 10 to mean (as it certainly
does) "living creatures," and to allude (as it surely
does not) to the quails that fell round the camp.
Most commentators now agree in transferring "thine
inheritance" to the first clause, and in understanding
it of the people, not of the land. The verse is intelligible
either as referring to gifts of refreshment of spirit
and courage bestowed on the people, in which case
"rain" is symbolical; or to actual rainfall during the
forty years of desert life, by which sowing and reaping
were made possible. The division of the verse as in
our translation is now generally adopted. The allusion
to the provision of corn in the desert is continued in
ver. 10, in which the chief difficulty is the ambiguous
word "assembly." It may mean "living creatures," and
is so taken here by the LXX. and others. It is twice
used in 2 Sam. xxii. 11 (?), 13, for an army. Delitzsch
takes it as a comparison of Israel to a flock, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
retaining the meaning of <i>creatures</i>. If the verse is
interpreted as alluding to Israel's wilderness life,
"therein" must be taken in a somewhat irregular
construction, since there is no feminine noun at hand to
which the feminine pronominal suffix in the word can be
referred. In that barren desert, God's flock dwelt for
more than a generation, and during all that time His
goodness provided for them. The strophe thus gives
two aspects of God's manifestation in the wilderness&mdash;the
majestic and terrible, and the gentle and beneficent.
In the psalmist's triumphant retrospect no allusion is
made to the dark obverse&mdash;Israel's long ingratitude.
The same history which supplies other psalmists and
prophets with material for penetrating accusations
yields to this one only occasion of praise. God's part
is pure goodness; man's is shaded with much rebellious
murmuring.</p>

<p>The next strophe (vv. 11-14) is abrupt and disconnected,
as if echoing the hurry of battle and the tumult
of many voices on the field. The general drift is
unmistakable, but the meaning of part is the despair
of commentators. The whole scene of the conflict,
flight, and division of the spoil is flashed before us in
brief clauses, panting with excitement and blazing with
the glow of victory. "The Lord giveth the word."
That "word" may be the news which the women
immediately repeat. But it is far more vivid and truer
to the spirit of the psalm, which sees God as the only
actor in Israel's history, to regard it as the self-fulfilling
decree which scatters the enemy. This battle is the
Lord's. There is no description of conflict. But one
mighty word is hurled from heaven, like a thunder-clap
(the phrase resembles that employed so often, "the
Lord gave His voice," which frequently means thunder-peals),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
and the enemies' ranks are broken in panic.
Israel does not need to fight. God speaks, and the next
sound we hear is the clash of timbrels and the clear
notes of the maidens chanting victory. This picture of
a battle, with the battle left out, tells best Who fought,
and how He fought it. "He spake, and it was done."
What scornful picture of the flight is given by the
reduplication "they flee, they flee"! It is like Deborah's
fierce gloating over the dead Sisera: "He bowed, he fell,
he lay: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed,
there he fell." What confidence in the power of weakness,
when God is on its side, in the antithesis between
the mighty kings scattered in a general <i>sauve qui peut</i>,
and the matrons who had "tarried at home" and now
divide the spoil! Sisera's mother was pictured in
Deborah's song as looking long through her lattice for
her son's return, and solacing herself with the thought
that he delayed to part the plunder and would come
back laden with it. What she vainly hoped for Israel's
matrons enjoy.</p>

<p>Vv. 13, 14, are among the hardest in the Psalter.
The separate clauses offer no great difficulties, but the
connection is enigmatical indeed. "Will (lit. <i>if</i>) ye lie
among the sheepfolds?" comes from Deborah's song
(Judg. v. 16), and is there a reproach flung at Reuben
for preferring pastoral ease to warlike effort. Is it
meant as reproach here? It is very unlikely that a
song of triumph like this should have for its only
mention of Israel's warriors a taunt. The lovely
picture of the dove with iridescent wings is as a
picture perfect. But what does it mean here? Herder,
whom Hupfeld follows, supposes that the whole
verse is rebuke to recreants, who preferred lying
stretched at ease among their flocks, and bidding each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
other admire the glancing plumage of the doves that
flitted round them. But this is surely violent, and
smacks of modern æstheticism. Others suppose that
the first clause is a summons to be up and pursue the
flying foe, and the second and third a description of
the splendour with which the conquerors (or their
households) should be clothed by the spoil. This
meaning would require the insertion of some such
phrase as "ye shall be" before the second clause.
Delitzsch regards the whole as a connected description
of the blessings of peace following on victory, and sees
a reference to Israel as God's dove. "The new condition
of prosperity is compared with the play of colours of a
dove basking in the rays of the sun." All these interpretations
assume that Israel is addressed in the first
clause. But is this assumption warranted? Is it not
more natural to refer the "ye" to the "kings" just
mentioned, especially as the psalmist recurs to them in
the next verse? The question will then retain the
taunting force which it has in Deborah's song, while it
pictures a very different kind of couching among the
sheepfolds&mdash;namely, the hiding there from pursuit. The
kings are first seen in full flight. Then the triumphant
psalmist flings after them the taunt, "Will ye hide
among the cattle?" If the initial particle retains its
literal force, the first clause is hypothetical, and the
suppression of the conclusion speaks more eloquently
than its expression would have done: "If ye couch&mdash;&mdash;"
The second and third clauses are then parallel with the
second of ver. 12, and carry on the description of the
home-keeping matron, "the dove," adorned with rich
spoils and glorious in her apparel. We thus have a
complete parallelism between the two verses, which
both lay side by side the contrasted pictures of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
defeated kings and the women; and we further establish
continuity between the three verses (13-15), in so far
as the "kings" are dealt with in them all.</p>

<p>Ver. 14 is even harder than the preceding. What
does "in it" refer to? Is the second clause metaphor,
requiring to be eked out with "It is like as when"?
If figure, what does it mean? One is inclined to say
with Baethgen, at the end of his comment on the words,
"After all this, I can only confess that I do not understand
the verse." Salmon was an inconsiderable hill
in Central Palestine, deriving its name (Shady), as is
probable, from forests on its sides. Many commentators
look to that characteristic for explanation of the riddle.
Snow on the dark hill would show very white. So after
the defeat the bleached bones of the slain, or, as others,
their glittering armour, would cover the land. Others
take the point of comparison to be the change from
trouble to joy which follows the foe's defeat, and is
likened to the change of the dark hillside to a gleaming
snow-field. Hupfeld still follows Herder in connecting
the verse with the reproach which he finds in
the former one, and seeing in the words "It snowed on
Salmon" the ground of the recreants' disinclination to
leave the sheepfolds&mdash;namely, that it was bad weather,
and that, if snow lay on Salmon in the south, it would
be worse in the north, where the campaign was going
on! He acknowledges that this explanation requires
"a good deal of acuteness to discover," and says that
the only alternative to accepting it, provisionally, at all
events, is to give up the hope of any solution. Cheyne
follows Bickell in supposing that part of the text has
dropped out, and proposes an additional clause at the
beginning of the verse and an expansion of the last
clause, arriving at this result: "[For full is our land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
spoil], When Shaddai scatters kings therein, [As the
snow,] when it snows in Salmon." The adoption of
these additions is not necessary to reach this meaning
of the whole, which appears the most consonant with
the preceding verses, as continuing the double reference
which runs through them&mdash;namely, to the fugitive kings
and the dividers of the spoil. On the one side we see
the kings driven from their lurking-places among the
sheepfolds; on the other, the gleam of rich booty, compared
now to the shining white wrapping the dark hill,
as formerly to the colours that shimmer on sunlit pinions
of peaceful doves. If this is not the meaning, we can
only fall back on the confession already quoted.</p>

<p>The battle is over, and now the Conqueror enters
His palace-temple. The third strophe soars with its
theme, describing His triumphal entry thither and permanent
abiding there. The long years between the
conquest of Canaan and the establishment of the ark
on Zion dwindle to a span; for God's enthronement
there was in one view the purpose of the conquest,
which was incomplete till that was effected. There is no
need to suppose any reference in the mention of Bashan
to the victories over Og, its ancient king. The noble
figure needs no historic allusion to explain it. These
towering heights beyond Jordan had once in many places
been seats of idol worship. They are emblems of the
world's power. No light rests upon them, lofty though
they are, like that which glorifies the insignificant top
of Zion. They may well look enviously across the
Jordan to the hill which God has desired for His abode.
His triumphal procession is not composed of earthly
warriors, for none such had appeared in the battle.
He had conquered, not by employing human hands,
but by His own "bright-harnessed angels." They now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
surround Him in numbers innumerable, which language
strains its power in endeavouring to reckon. "Myriads
doubled, thousands of repetition," says the psalmist&mdash;indefinite
expressions for a countless host. But all
their wide-flowing ranks are clustered round the
Conqueror, whose presence makes their multitude an
unity, even as it gives their immortal frames their life
and strength, and their faces all their lustrous beauty.
"God is in the midst of them"; therefore they conquer
and exult. "Sinai is in the sanctuary." This bold
utterance has led to a suggested emendation, which has
the advantage of bringing out clearly a quotation from
Deut. xxxiii. 2. It combines the second and third
clauses of ver. 17, and renders "The Lord hath come
from Sinai into the sanctuary." But the existing text
gives a noble thought&mdash;that now, by the entrance of
God thither, Sinai itself is in the sanctuary, and all the
ancient sanctities and splendours, which flamed round
its splintered peaks, are housed to shine lambent from
that humble hill. Sinai was nothing but for God's
presence. Zion has that presence; and all that it
ever meant it means still. The profound sense of the
permanent nature of past revelation, which speaks all
through the psalm, reaches its climax here.</p>

<p>The "height" to which ver. 18 triumphantly proclaims
that God has gone up, can only be Zion. To take it as
meaning the heavenly sanctuary, as in Psalm vii. 7 it
unquestionably does, is forbidden by the preceding
verses. Thither the conquering God has ascended,
as to His palace, leading a long procession of bound
captives, and there receiving tribute from the vanquished.
Assyrian slabs and Egyptian paintings illustrate
these representations. The last clause has been
variously construed and understood. Is "Yea, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the rebellious" to be connected with the preceding, and
"among" to be supplied, so that those once rebellious
are conceived of as tributary, or does the phrase begin
an independent clause? The latter construction makes
the remainder of the verse run more intelligibly, and
obviates the need for supplying a preposition with "the
rebellious." It still remains a question whether the
last words of the clause refer to God's dwelling among
the submissive rebels, or to their dwelling with God.
If, however, it is kept in view that the context speaks
of God as dwelling in His sanctuary, the latter is the
more natural explanation, especially as a forcible contrast
is thereby presented to the fate of the "rebellious"
in ver. 6. They dwell in a burnt-up land; but,
if they fling away their enmity, may be guests of God
in His sanctuary. Thus the first half of the psalm
closes with grand prophetic hopes that, when God has
established His abode on Zion, distant nations shall
bring their tribute, rebels return to allegiance, and men
be dwellers with God in His house.</p>

<p>In such anticipations the psalm is Messianic, inasmuch
as these are only fulfilled in the dominion of Jesus.
Paul's quotation of this verse in Eph. iv. 8 does not
require us to maintain its directly prophetic character.
Rather, the apostle, as Calvin says, "deflects" it to
Christ. That ascent of the ark to Zion was a type
rather than a prophecy. Conflict, conquest, triumphant
ascent to a lofty home, tribute, widespread submission,
and access for rebels to the royal presence&mdash;all these,
which the psalmist saw as facts or hopes in their
earthly form, are repeated in loftier fashion in Christ,
or are only attainable through His universal reign.
The apostle significantly alters "received among" into
"gave to," sufficiently showing that he is not arguing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
from a verbal prophecy, but from a typical fact, and
bringing out the two great truths, that, in the highest
manifestation of the conquering God, the conquered
receive gifts from the victor, and that the gifts which
the ascended Christ bestows are really the trophies of
His battle, in which He bound the strong man and
spoiled his house. The attempt to make out that the
Hebrew word has the extraordinary doubled-barrelled
meaning of <i>receiving in order to give</i> is futile, and obscures
the intentional freedom with which the apostle deals
with the text. The Ascension is, in the fullest sense,
the enthronement of God; and its results are the growing
submission of nations and the happy dwelling of
even the rebellious in His house.</p>

<p>The rapturous emphasis with which this psalm
celebrates God's entrance into His sanctuary is most
appropriate to Davidic times.</p>

<p>The psalm reaches its climax in God's enthronement
on Zion. Its subsequent strophes set forth the results
thereof. The first of these, the fifth of the psalm
(vv. 19-23), suddenly drops from strains of exultation
to a plaintive note, and then again as suddenly breaks
out into stern rejoicing over the ruin of the foe. There
is wonderful depth of insight and tenderness in laying
side by side the two thoughts of God, that He sits on
high as conqueror, and that He daily bears our burdens,
or perhaps bears us as a shepherd might his lambs.</p>

<p>Truly a Divine use for Divine might! To such
lowly offices of continual individualising care will the
Master of many legions stoop, reaching out from amid
their innumerable myriads to sustain a poor weak man
stumbling under a load too great for him. Israel had
been delivered by a high hand, but still was burdened.
The psalmist has been recalling the deeds of old, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
he finds in them grounds for calm assurance as to the
present. To-day, he thinks, is as full of God as any
yesterday, and our "burdens" as certain to be borne
by Him, as were those of the generation that saw
His Sinai tremble at His presence. To us, as to them,
He is "a God of deliverances," and for us can provide
ways of escape from death. The words breathe a
somewhat plaintive sense of need, such as shades our
brightest moments, if we bethink ourselves; but they
do not oblige us to suppose that the psalm is the product
of a time of oppression and dejection. That theory
is contradicted by the bounding gladness of the former
part, no less than by the confident anticipations of the
second half. But no song sung by mortal lips is true
to the singer's condition, if it lacks the minor key into
which this hymn of triumph is here modulated for a
moment.</p>

<p>It is but for a moment, and what follows is startlingly
different. Israel's escape from death is secured
by the destruction of the enemy, and in it the psalmist
has joy. He pictures the hand that sustained him and
his fellows so tenderly, shattering the heads of the
rebellious. These are described as long-haired, an
emblem of strength and insolence which one is almost
tempted to connect with Absalom; and the same idea of
determined and flaunting sin is conveyed by the expression
"goes on in his guiltinesses." There will be such
rebels, even though the house of God is open for them
to dwell in, and there can be but one end for such. If
they do not submit, they will be crushed. The psalmist
is as sure of that as of God's gentleness; and his two
clauses do state the alternative that every man has to
face&mdash;either to let God bear his burden or to be smitten
by Him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>Vv. 22, 23, give a terrible picture of the end of the
rebels. The psalmist hears the voice of the Lord promising
to bring some unnamed fugitives from Bashan
and the depths of the sea in order that they may be
slain, and that he (or Israel) may bathe his foot in their
blood, and his dogs may lick it, as they did Ahab's.
Who are to be brought back? Some have thought that
the promise referred to Israel, but it is more natural to
apply it to the flying foe. There is no reference to
Bashan either as the kingdom of an ancient enemy
or as envying Zion (ver. 15). But the high land of
Bashan in the east and the depths of the sea to the
west are taken (<i>cf.</i> Amos ix. 1-3) as representing the
farthest and most inaccessible hiding-places. Wherever
the enemies lurk, thence they will be dragged and slain.</p>

<p>The existing text is probably to be amended by the
change of one letter in the verb, so as to read "shall
wash" or bathe, as in Psalm lviii. 10, and the last
clause to be read, "That the tongue of thy dogs may
have its portion from the enemy." The blood runs
ankle-deep, and the dogs feast on the carcasses or lick
it&mdash;a dreadful picture of slaughter and fierce triumph.
It is not to be softened or spiritualised or explained
away.</p>

<p>There is, no doubt, a legitimate Christian joy in the
fall of opposition to Christ's kingdom, and the purest
benevolence has sometimes a right to be glad when
hoary oppressions are swept away and their victims
set free; but such rejoicing is not after the Christian
law unless it is mingled with pity, of which the psalm
has no trace.</p>

<p>The next strophe (vv. 24-27) is by some regarded
as resuming the description of the procession, which
is supposed to have been interrupted by the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
strophe. But the joyous march now to be described
is altogether separate from the majestic progress of the
conquering King in vv. 17, 18. This is the consequence
of that. God has gone into His sanctuary. His
people have seen His solemn entrance thither, and
therefore they now go up to meet Him there with
song and music. Their festal procession is the second
result of His enthronement, of which the deliverance
and triumph described in the preceding strophe were
the first. The people escaped from death flock to thank
their Deliverer. Such seems to be the connection of
the whole, and especially of vv. 24, 25. Instead of
myriads of angels surrounding the conquering God,
here are singers and flute-players and damsels beating
their timbrels, like Miriam and her choir. Their shrill
call in ver. 26 summons all who "spring from the
fountain of Israel"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, from the eponymous patriarch&mdash;to
bless God. After these musicians and singers, the
psalmist sees tribe after tribe go up to the sanctuary,
and points to each as it passes. His enumeration is
not free from difficulties, both in regard to the epithets
employed and the specification of the tribes. The
meaning of the word rendered "ruler" is disputed.
Its form is peculiar, and the meaning of the verb from
which it is generally taken to come is rather to <i>subdue</i>
or <i>tread down</i> than to <i>rule</i>. If the signification of <i>ruler</i>
is accepted, a question rises as to the sense in which
Benjamin is so called. Allusion to Saul's belonging
to that tribe is thought of by some; but this seems
improbable, whether the psalm is Davidic or later.
Others think that the allusion is to the fact that, according
to Joshua xviii. 16, the Temple was within Benjamite
territory; but that is a far-fetched explanation.
Others confine the "rule" to the procession, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
Benjamin marches at the head, and so may be called
its leader; but ruling and leading are not the same.
Others get a similar result by a very slight textual
change, reading "in front" instead of "their ruler."
Another difficulty is in the word rendered above "their
shouting multitude," which can only be made to mean
a company of people by a somewhat violent twist.
Hupfeld (with whom Bickell and Cheyne agree) proposes
an alteration which yields the former sense and
is easy. It may be tentatively adopted.</p>

<p>A more important question is the reason for the
selection of the four tribes named. The mention of
Benjamin and Judah is natural; but why are Zebulun
and Naphtali the only representatives of the other
tribes? The defenders of a late date answer, as has
been already noticed, Because in the late period when
the psalm was written, Galilee and Judæa "formed the
two orthodox provinces." The objection to this is that
in the post-exilic period there were no distinct tribes
of Zebulun and Naphtali, and no princes to rule.</p>

<p>The mention of these tribes as sharing in the procession
to the sanctuary on Zion would have been
impossible during the period of the northern kingdom.
If, then, these two periods are excluded, what is left
but the Davidic? The fact seems to be that we have
here another glance at Deborah's song, in which the
daring valour of these two tribes is set in contrast
with the sluggish cowardice of Reuben and the other
northern ones. Those who had done their part in the
wars of the Lord now go up in triumph to His house.
That is the reward of God's faithful soldiers.</p>

<p>The next strophe (vv. 28-31) is the prayer of the
procession. It falls into two parts of two verses each,
of which the former verse is petition, and the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
confident anticipation of the results of answered prayer.
The symmetry of the whole requires the substitution
in ver. 28 of "command" for "hath commanded."
God's strength is poetically regarded as distinct from
Himself and almost personified, as "loving-kindness"
is in Psalm xlii. 8. The prayer is substantially
equivalent to the following petition in ver. 28 <i>b</i>. Note
how "strength" occurs four times in vv. 33-35. The
prayer for its present manifestation is, in accordance
with the historical retrospect of the first part, based
upon God's past acts. It has been proposed to detach
"From Thy Temple" from ver. 29, and to attach it
to ver. 28. This gets over a difficulty, but unduly
abbreviates ver. 29, and is not in harmony with the
representation in the former part, which magnifies
what God has wrought, not "from the Temple," but
in His progress thither. No doubt the retention of
the words in ver. 29 introduces a singular expression
there. How can presents be brought to God "from
Thy Temple"? The only explanation is that "Temple"
is used in a restricted sense for the "holy place," as
distinguished from the "holy of holies," in which the
ark was contained. The tribute-bearers stand in that
outer sanctuary, and thence present their tokens of
fealty. The city is clustered round the Temple mount,
and therefore the psalm says, "Thy Temple above
Jerusalem." One is tempted to read "unto" instead
of "from"; for this explanation can scarcely be called
quite satisfactory. But it seems the best that has
been suggested. The submission of kings of unnamed
lands is contemplated as the result of God's manifestation
of strength for Israel. Ver. 30 resumes the tone
of petition, and maintains it throughout. "The beast
of the reeds," probably the crocodile, is a poetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
designation for Egypt, the reference to which is
claimed by both the defenders of the Davidic and of the
post-exilic date as in their favour. The former say
that, in David's day, Egypt was the greatest world-power
known to the Hebrews; and the latter, that the
mention of it points to the time when Israel lay
exposed to the attacks of Seleucidæ on the one hand
and of Ptolemies on the other. Why, then, should
only one of the two hostile neighbours be mentioned
here? "Bulls" are a standing emblem of leaders of
nations, and "calves" are accordingly their subjects.
The two metaphors are naturally connected, and the
correction "leaders of the peoples" is unnecessary,
and a prosaic intermingling of figure and fact.</p>

<p>Ver. 30 <i>c</i> is extremely obscure. Baethgen roundly
says, "The meaning of the words can no longer be
ascertained, and in all probability they are corrupt."
The first word is a participle, which is variously taken
as meaning "casting oneself to the ground" (<i>i.e.</i>, in
submission), and "trampling to the ground." It is
also variously referred to the nations and their leaders
spoken of in the previous verse, and to God. In the
former case it would describe their attitude of submission
in consequence of "rebuke"; in the latter, God's
subjugation of them. The slightest change would
make the word an imperative, thus bringing it into
line with "rebuke"; but, even without this, the reference
to God is apparently to be preferred. The
structure of the strophe which, in the first verse of
each pair, seems to put petitions and to confine its
descriptions of the resulting subjugation of the enemy
to the second verse in each case, favours the latter
interpretation. The next words are also disputed.
One rendering is, "with bars of silver"; another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
"those that delight in silver." The former presupposes
a very unusual word for "bars." It is necessarily
adopted by those who refer the first word to the submission
of the "herd of bulls." The enemies come
with tribute of silver. The other rendering, which
avoids the necessity of bringing in an otherwise unknown
word, is necessarily preferred by the supporters
of the second explanation of the preceding word. God
is implored to crush "those who delight in silver,"
which may stand for a description of men of this world,
but must be acknowledged to be rather a singular
way of designating active enemies of God and Israel.
Cheyne's rendering, "That rolls itself in mire for gain
of money," brings in the mercenaries of the Seleucidæ.
But "rolling oneself in mire" is a strange way of saying
"hiring oneself out to fight." Certainty seems unattainable,
and we must be content with the general
trend of the verse as supplication for an exhibition
of God's strength against proud opponents. The last
clause sums up the whole in the petition, "Scatter the
peoples that delight in wars."</p>

<p>One verse then tells what the result of that will be.
"Great ones" shall come from the land of the beast of
the reeds, and Ethiopia shall make haste to stretch out
tribute-bearing hands to God. The vision of a world
subjugated and loving its subjugation is rising before
the poet. That is the end of the ways of God with
Israel. So deeply had this psalmist been led into
comprehension of the Divine purpose; so clearly was
he given to see the future, "and all the wonder that
should be."</p>

<p>Therefore he breaks forth, in the last strophe, into
invocation to all the kingdoms of the earth to sing to
God. He had sung of His majesty as of old Jehovah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
"rode through the deserts"; and that phrase described
His intervention in the field of history on behalf of
Israel. Now the singer calls for praise from all the earth
to Him who rides in the "most ancient heavens"; and
that expression sets forth His transcendent majesty and
eternal, universal sway. The psalmist had hymned the
victory won when "God gave the word." Now he bids
earth listen as "He gives His voice, a voice of strength,"
which moves and controls all creatures and events.
Therefore all nations are summoned to give strength
to God, who gives all fulnesses of strength to His
people. The psalm closes with the utterance of the
thought which has animated it throughout&mdash;that God's
deeds for and in Israel are the manifestation for the
world of His power, and that these will one day lead
all men to bless the God of Israel, who shines out in
dread majesty from the sanctuary, which is henceforth
His abode for evermore.</p>

<p>The Davidic authorship of this psalm is evidently
untenable, if for no other reason, yet because of
the state of things presupposed in ver. 35. The supposition
that Jeremiah was the author has more in its
favour than in the case of many of the modern attributions
of psalms to him, even if, as seems most
probable, the references to sinking in deep mire and the
like are metaphorical. Cheyne fixes on the period preceding
Nehemiah's first journey to Jerusalem as the
earliest possible date for this psalm and its kindred
ones (xxii., xxxv., and xl. 13-18). Baethgen follows
Olshausen in assigning the psalm to the Maccabean
period. The one point which seems absolutely certain
is that David was not its author.</p>

<p>It falls into two equal parts (vv. 1-18 and 19-36).
In the former part three turns of thought or feeling
may be traced: vv. 1-6 being mainly a cry for Divine
help, with plaintive spreading out of the psalmist's
extremity of need; vv. 7-12 basing the prayer on
the fact that his sufferings flow from his religion;
and vv. 13-18 being a stream of petitions for deliverance,
with continuous allusion to the description of
his trials in vv. 1-6. The second part (vv. 19-36)
begins with renewed description of the psalmist's
affliction (vv. 19-21), and thence passes to invocation
of God's justice on his foes (vv. 22-28), which takes
the place of the direct petitions for deliverance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
first part. The whole closes with trustful anticipation
of answers to prayer, which will call forth praise from
ever-widening circles,&mdash;first from the psalmist himself;
then from the oppressed righteous; and, finally, from
heaven, earth, and sea.</p>

<p>The numerous citations of this psalm in the New
Testament have led many commentators to maintain
its directly Messianic character. But its confessions of
sin and imprecations of vengeance are equally incompatible
with that view. It is Messianic as typical
rather than as prophetic, exhibiting a history, whether
of king, prophet, righteous man, or personified nation,
in which the same principles are at work as are manifest
in their supreme energy and highest form in the
Prince of righteous sufferers. But the correspondence
of such a detail as giving gall and vinegar, with the
history of Jesus, carries us beyond the region of types,
and is a witness that God's Spirit shaped the utterances
of the psalmist for a purpose unknown to himself, and
worked in like manner on the rude soldiers, whose
clumsy mockery and clumsy kindness fulfilled ancient
words. There is surely something more here than
coincidence or similarity between the experience of
one righteous sufferer and another. If Jesus cried
"I thirst" in order to bring about the "fulfilment" of
one verse of our psalm, His doing so is of a piece with
some other acts of His which were distinct claims to
be the Messiah of prophecy; but His wish could not
influence the soldiers to fulfil the psalm.</p>

<p>The first note is petition and spreading out of the
piteous story of the psalmist's need. The burdened
heart finds some ease in describing how heavy its
burden is, and the devout heart receives some foretaste
of longed-for help in the act of telling God how sorely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
His help is needed. He who knows all our trouble is
glad to have us tell it to Him, since it is thereby
lightened, and our faith in Him is thereby increased.
Sins confessed are wholly cancelled, and troubles
spoken to God are more than half calmed. The
psalmist begins with metaphors in vv. 1, 2, and translates
these into grim prose in vv. 3, 4, and then,
with acknowledgment of sinfulness, cries for God's
intervention in vv. 5, 6. It is flat and prosaic to take
the expressions in vv. 1, 2, literally, as if they described
an experience like Jeremiah's in the miry pit.
Nor can the literal application be carried through; for
the image of "waters coming in unto the soul" brings
up an entirely different set of circumstances from that
of sinking in mud in a pit. The one describes trouble
as rushing in upon a man, like a deluge which has burst
its banks and overwhelms him; the other paints it as
yielding and tenacious, affording no firm spot to stand
on, but sucking him up in its filthy, stifling slime. No
water was in Jeremiah's pit. The two figures are
incompatible in reality, and can only be blended in
imagination. What they mean is put without metaphor
in vv. 3, 4. The psalmist is "weary with calling" on
God; his throat is dry with much prayer; his eyes ache
and are dim with upward gazing for help which lingers.
Yet he does not cease to call, and still prays with his
parched throat, and keeps the weary eyes steadfastly
fixed, as the psalm shows. It is no small triumph of
patient faith to wait for tarrying help. Ver. 4 tells why
he thus cries. He is compassed by a crowd of enemies.
Two things especially characterise these&mdash;their numbers,
and their gratuitous hatred. As to the former, they are
described as more numerous than the hairs of the
psalmist's head. The parallelism of clauses recommends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
the textual alteration which substitutes for the unnecessary
word "my destroyers" the appropriate expression
"more than my bones," which is found in some old
versions. Causeless hatred is the portion of the
righteous in all ages; and our Lord points to Himself
as experiencing it in utmost measure (John xv. 25), inasmuch
as He, the perfectly righteous One, must take
into His own history all the bitterness which is infused
into the cup of those who fear God and love the right,
by a generation who are out of sympathy with them.</p>

<p>The same experience, in forms varying according to
the spirit of the times, is realised still in all who have
the mind of Christ in them. As long as the world is
a world, it will have some contempt mingling with its
constrained respect for goodness, some hostility, now
expressed by light shafts of mockery and ridicule, now
by heavier and more hurtful missiles, for Christ's true
servants. The ancient "Woe" for those of whom "all
men speak well" is in force to-day. The "hatred" is
"without a cause," in so far as its cherishers have
received no hurt, and its objects desire only their
enemies' good; but its cause lies deep in the irreconcilable
antagonism of life-principles and aims between
those who follow Christ and those who do not.</p>

<p>The psalmist had to bear unjust charges, and to make
restitution of what he had never taken. Causeless
hatred justified itself by false accusations, and innocence
had but to bear silently and to save life at the expense
of being robbed in the name of justice.</p>

<p>He turns from enemies to God. But his profession
of innocence assumes a touching and unusual form.
He does not, as might be expected, say, "Thou knowest
my guiltlessness," but, "Thou knowest my foolishness."
A true heart, while conscious of innocence in regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
to men, and of having done nothing to evoke their
enmity, is, even in the act of searching itself, arrested
by the consciousness of its many sins in God's sight,
and will confess these the more penitently, because it
stands upright before men, and asserts its freedom from
all crime against them. In so far as men's hatred is
God's instrument, it inflicts merited chastisement. That
does not excuse men; but it needs to be acknowledged
by the sufferer, if things are to be right between him
and God. Then, after such confession, he can pray, as
this psalmist does, that God's mercy may deliver him,
so that others who, like him, wait on God may not be
disheartened or swept from their confidence, by the
spectacle of his vain hopes and unanswered cries. The
psalmist has a strong consciousness of his representative
character, and, as in so many other psalms, thinks
that his experience is of wide significance as a witness
for God. This consciousness points to something
special in his position, whether we find the speciality
in his office, or in the supposed personification of the
nation, or in poetic consciousness heightened by the
sense of being an organ of God's Spirit. In a much
inferior degree, the lowliest devout man may feel the
same; for there are none whose experiences of God as
answering prayer may not be a light of hope to some
souls sitting in the dark.</p>

<p>In vv. 7-12 the prayer for deliverance is urged on
the ground that the singer's sufferings are the result
of his devotion. Psalm xliv. 13-22 may be compared,
and Jer. xv. 15 is an even closer parallel. Fasting
and sackcloth are mentioned again together in Psalm
xxxv. 13; and Lam. iii. 14 and Job xxx. 9 resemble
ver. 12 <i>b</i>. Surrounded by a godless generation, the
psalmist's earnestness of faith and concern for God's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
honour made him an object of dislike, a target for
drunken ridicule. These broke the strong ties of
kindred, and acted as separating forces more strongly
than brotherhood did, as a uniting one. "Zeal for God's
house" presupposes the existence of the Temple, and
also either its neglect or its desecration. That sunken
condition of the sanctuary distressed the psalmist more
than personal calamity, and it was the departure of Israel
from God that made him clothe himself in sackcloth
and fast and weep. But so far had deterioration gone
that his mourning and its cause supplied materials for
tipsy mirth, and his name became a by-word and a
butt for malicious gossip. The whole picture is that
of the standing experience of the godly among the
godless. The Perfect Example of devotion and communion
had to pass through these waters where they
ran deepest and chilliest, but all who have His Spirit
have their share of the same fate.</p>

<p>The last division of this first part (vv. 13-18) begins
by setting in strong contrast the psalmist's prayer and
the drunkard's song. He is sure that his cry will
be heard, and so he calls the present time "a time of
favour," and appeals, as often in the Psalter, to the
multitude of God's loving-kindnesses and the faithfulness
of His promise of salvation. Such a pleading
with God on the ground of His manifested character
is heard in vv. 13, 16, thus inclosing, as it were,
the prayer for deliverance in a wrapping of reminders
to God of His own name. The petitions here echo
the description of peril in the former part&mdash;mire and
watery depths&mdash;and add another kindred image in that
of the "pit shutting her mouth" over the suppliant.
He is plunged in a deep dungeon, well-shaped; and
if a stone is rolled on to its opening, his last gleam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
of daylight will be gone, and he will be buried alive.
Beautifully do the pleas from God's character and those
from the petitioner's sore need alternate, the latter
predominating in vv. 17, 18. His thoughts pass from
his own desperate condition to God's mercy, and from
God's mercy to his own condition, and he has the
reward of faith, in that he finds in his straits reasons
for his assurance that this is a time of favour, as well
as pleas to urge with God. They make the black
backing which turns his soul into a mirror, reflecting
God's promises in its trust.</p>

<p>The second part of the psalm (ver. 19 to end) has, like
the former, three main divisions. The first of these,
like vv. 1-6, is mainly a renewed spreading before God
of the psalmist's trouble (vv. 19-21). Rooted sorrows
are not plucked up by one effort. This recrudescence
of fear breaking in upon the newly won serenity of
faith is true to nature. On some parts of our coasts,
where a narrow outlet hinders the free run of the tide,
a second high water follows the first after an hour or
so; and often a similar bar to the flowing away of fears
brings them back in full rush after they had begun to
sink. The psalmist had appealed to God's knowledge
of His "foolishness" as indorsing his protestations of
innocence towards men. He now (ver. 19) appeals
to His knowledge of his distresses, as indorsing his
pitiful plaints. His soul is too deeply moved now to
use metaphors. He speaks no more of mire and flood,
but we hear the moan of a broken heart, and that wail
which sounds sad across the centuries and wakes echoes
in many solitary hearts. The psalmist's eyes had failed,
while he looked upwards for a God whose coming
seemed slow; but they had looked yet more wearily
and vainly for human pity and comforters, and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
none. Instead of pity He had received only aggravation
of misery. Such seems to be the force of giving
gall for food, and vinegar to His thirst. The precise
meaning of the word rendered "gall" is uncertain, but
the general idea of something bitter is sufficient. That
was all that His foes would give Him when hungry;
and vinegar, which would make Him more thirsty still,
was all that they proffered for His thirst. Such was
their sympathy and comforting. According to Matthew,
the potion of "wine (or vinegar) mingled with gall"
was offered to and rejected by Jesus, before being
fastened to the cross. He does not expressly quote
the psalm, but probably refers to it. John, on the other
hand, does tell us that Jesus, "that the scripture might
be accomplished, said, I thirst," and sees its fulfilment
in the kindly act of moistening the parched lips. The
evangelist's expression does not necessarily imply that
a desire to fulfil the scripture was our Lord's motive.
Crucifixion was accompanied with torturing thirst,
which wrung that last complaint from Jesus. But the
evangelist discerns a Divine purpose behind the utterance
of Jesus' human weakness; and it is surely less
difficult, for any one who believes in supernatural
revelation at all, to believe that the words of the
psalmist were shaped by a higher power, and the
hands of the Roman soldiers moved by another impulse
than their own, than to believe that this minute correspondence
of psalm and gospel is merely accidental.</p>

<p>But the immediately succeeding section warns us
against pushing the Messianic character of the psalm
too far, for these fearful imprecations cannot have any
analogies in Christ's words (vv. 22-28). The form of the
wish in "Let their table become a snare" is explained
by remembering that the Eastern table was often a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
leather flap laid on the ground, which the psalmist
desires may start up as a snare, and close upon the
feasters as they sit round it secure. Disease, continual
terror, dimmed eyes, paralysed or quaking loins, ruin
falling on their homes, and desolation round their
encampment, so that they have no descendants, are the
least of the evils invoked. The psalmist's desires go
further than all this corporeal and material disaster.
He prays that iniquity may be added to their iniquity&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
that they may be held guilty of sin after sin; and
that they may have no portion in God's righteousness&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
in the gifts which flow from His adherence to His
covenant.</p>

<p>The climax of all these maledictions is that awful wish
that the persecutors may be blotted out of the book of
life or of the living. True, the high New Testament
conception of that book, according to which it is the
burgess-roll of the citizens of the New Jerusalem, the
possessors of eternal life, does not plainly belong to it
in Old Testament usage, in which it means apparently
the register of those living on earth. But to blot names
therefrom is not only to kill, but to exclude from the
national community, and so from all the privileges of
the people of God. The psalmist desires for his foes
the accumulation of all the ills that flesh is heir to, the
extirpation of their families, and their absolute exclusion
from the company of the living and the righteous. It is
impossible to bring such utterances into harmony with
the teachings of Jesus, and the attempt to vindicate
them ignores plain facts and does violence to plain
words. Better far to let them stand as a monument of
the earlier stage of God's progressive revelation, and
discern clearly the advance which Christian ethics has
made on them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>The psalm ends with glad anticipations of deliverance
and vows of thanksgiving. The psalmist is
sure that God's salvation will lift him high above his
enemies, and as sure that then he will be as grateful as
he is now earnest in prayer, and surest of all that his
thankful voice will sound sweeter in God's ear than
any sacrifice would smell in His nostrils. There is
no contempt of sacrifices expressed in "horned and
hoofed," but simply the idea of maturity which fits the
animal to be offered.</p>

<p>The single voice of praise will be caught up, the
singer thinks, by a great chorus of those who would
have been struck dumb with confusion if his prayer
had not been answered (ver. 6), and who, in like
manner, are gladdened by seeing his deliverance. The
grace bestowed on one brings thanksgivings from
many, which redound to the glory of God. The
sudden transition in ver. 32 <i>b</i> to direct address to the
seekers after God, as if they stood beside the solitary
singer, gives vividness to the anticipation. The insertion
of "behold" is warranted, and tells what revives
the beholders' hearts. The seekers after God feel
the pulse of a quicker life throbbing, when they see
the wonders wrought through prayer. The singer's
thoughts go beyond his own deliverance to that of
Israel. "His captives" is most naturally understood
as referring to the exiled nation. And this wider manifestation
of God's restoring power will evoke praise
from a wider circle, even from heaven, earth, and sea.
The circumstances contemplated in vv. 33-36 are
evidently those of a captivity. God's people are in
bondage, the cities of Judah are in ruins, the inhabitants
scattered far from their homes. The only reason
for taking the closing verses as being a liturgical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
addition is unwillingness to admit exilic or post-exilic
psalms. But these verses cannot be fairly interpreted
without recognising that they presuppose that Israel
is in bondage, or at least on the verge of it. The
circumstances of Jeremiah's life and times coincide
closely with those of the psalmist.</p>

</p>


<p>This psalm is all but identical with the last verses
of Psalm xl. 13-17. Some unimportant alterations
have been made, principally in the Divine names;
but the principle on which they have been made is not
obvious. It is scarcely correct to say, with Delitzsch,
that the psalm "has been transformed, so as to become
Elohistic"; for though it twice replaces the name of
Jehovah with that of God (vv. 1, 4), it makes the converse
change in ver. 5, last clause, by reading Jehovah
instead of "God," as in Psalm xl.</p>

<p>Other changes are of little moment. The principal
are in vv. 3 and 5. In the former the vehement wish
that the psalmist's mockers may be <i>paralysed with shame</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
is softened down into a desire that they may be <i>turned
back</i>. The two verbs are similar in sound, and the
substitution may have been accidental, a slip of memory
or a defect in hearing, or it may have been an artistic
variation of the original. In ver. 5 a prayer that God
will hasten to the psalmist's help takes the place of
an expression of confidence that "Jehovah purposes
[good]" to him, and again there is similarity of sound
in the two words. This change is like the subtle
alteration which a painter might make on his picture by
taking out one spot of high light. The gleam of confidence
is changed to a call of need, and the tone of
the whole psalm is thereby made more plaintive.</p>

<p>Hupfeld holds that this psalm is the original, and
Psalm xl. a composite; but most commentators agree in
regarding this as a fragment of that psalm. The cut
has not been very cleanly made; for the necessary verb
"be pleased" has been left behind, and the symmetry
of ver. 1 is destroyed for want of it. The awkward
incompleteness of this beginning witnesses that the
psalm is a fragment.</p>

<p>Echoes of former psalms make the staple of this
one, and even those parts of it which are not
quotations have little individuality. The themes are
familiar, and the expression of them is scarcely less
so. There is no well-defined strophical structure, and
little continuity of thought or feeling. Vv. 13 and 24 <i>b</i>
serve as a kind of partial refrain, and may be taken
as dividing the psalm into two parts, but there is little
difference between the contents of the two. Delitzsch
gives in his adhesion to the hypothesis that Jeremiah
was the author; and there is considerable weight in
the reasons assigned for that ascription of authorship.
The pensive, plaintive tone; the abundant quotations,
with slight alterations of the passages cited; the autobiographical
hints which fit in with Jeremiah's history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
are the chief of these. But they can scarcely be called
conclusive. There is more to be said for the supposition
that the singer is the personified nation in this
case than in many others. The sudden transition to
"us" in ver. 20, which the Massoretic marginal correction
corrects into "me," favours, though it does not
absolutely require, that view, which is also supported
by the frequent allusion to "youth" and "old age."
These, however, are capable of a worthy meaning, if
referring to an individual. Vv. 1-3 are slightly varied
from Psalm xxxi. 1-3. The character of the changes
win be best appreciated by setting the two passages
side by side.</p>

<p>The two verbs, which in the former psalm are in
separate clauses ("deliver" and "rescue"), are here
brought together. "Speedily" is omitted, and "save" is
substituted for "deliver," which has been drawn into
the preceding clause. Obviously no difference of
meaning is intended to be conveyed, and the changes
look very like the inaccuracies of memoriter quotations.
The next variation is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>The difference between "a strong rock" and "rock
of habitation" is but one letter. That between "for
a house of defence" and "to go to continually: Thou
hast commanded" is extremely slight, as Baethgen has
well shown. Possibly both of these variations are due
to textual corruption, but more probably this psalmist
intentionally altered the words of an older psalm.
Most of the old versions have the existing text, but
the LXX. seems to have read the Hebrew here as in
Psalm xxxi. The changes are not important, but they
are significant. That thought of God as a habitation
to which the soul may continually find access goes
very deep into the secrets of the devout life. The
variation in ver. 3 is recommended by observing the
frequent recurrence of "continually" in this psalm, of
which that word may almost be said to be the motto.
Nor is the thought of God's command given to His
multitude of unnamed servants, to save this poor man,
one which we can afford to lose.</p>

<p>Vv. 5, 6, are a similar variation of Psalm xxii. 9, 10.
"On Thee have I been stayed from the womb," says
this psalmist; "On Thee was I cast from the womb,"
says the original passage. The variation beautifully
brings out, not only reliance on God, but the Divine
response to that reliance by life-long upholding. That
strong arm answers leaning weakness with firm support,
and whosoever relies on it is upheld by it.
The word rendered above "protector" is doubtful. It
is substituted for that in Psalm xxii. 9 which means
"One that takes out," and some commentators would
attach the same meaning to the word used here, referring
it to God's goodness before and at birth. But it is better
taken as equivalent to benefactor, provider, or some such
designation, and as referring to God's lifelong care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>The psalmist has been "a wonder" to many spectators,
either in the sense that they have gazed astonished
at God's goodness, or, as accords better with the adversative
character of the next clause ("But Thou art
my refuge"), that his sufferings have been unexampled.
Both ideas may well be combined, for the life of every
man, if rightly studied, is full of miracles both of mercy
and judgment. If the psalm is the voice of an individual,
the natural conclusion from such words is that his life
was conspicuous; but it is obvious that the national
reference is appropriate here.</p>

<p>On this thankful retrospect of life-long help and life-long
trust the psalm builds a prayer for future protection
from eager enemies, who think that the charmed
life is vulnerable at last.</p>

<p>Vv. 9-13 rise to a height of emotion above the
level of the rest of the psalm. On one hypothesis,
we have in them the cry of an old man, whose
strength diminishes as his dangers increase. Something
undisclosed in his circumstances gave colour to
the greedy hopes of his enemies. Often prosperous
careers are overclouded at the end, and the piteous
spectacle is seen of age overtaken by tempests which
its feebleness cannot resist, and which are all the
worse to face because of the calms preceding them.
On the national hypothesis, the psalm is the prayer of
Israel at a late stage of its history, from which it looks
back to the miracles of old, and then to the ring of
enemies rejoicing over its apparent weakness, and then
upwards to the Eternal Helper.</p>

<p>Vv. 12, 13, are woven out of other psalms. 12 <i>a</i>, "Be
not far from me," is found in xxii. 11, 19; xxxv. 22;
xxxviii. 21, etc. "Haste to my help" is found in
xxxviii. 22; xl. 13 (lxx. 1). For ver. 13 compare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
xxxv. 4, 26; xl. 14 (lxx. 2). With this, as a sort
of refrain, the first part of the psalm ends.</p>

<p>The second part goes over substantially the same
ground, but with lighter heart. The confidence of
deliverance is more vivid, and it, as well as the vow
of praise following thereon, bulk larger. The singer
has thinned away his anxieties by speaking them to
God, and has by the same process solidified his faith.
Aged eyes should see God, the helper, more clearly
when earth begins to look grey and dim. The forward
look of such finds little to stay it on this side of heaven.
As there seems less and less to hope for here, there
should be more and more there. Youth is the time
for buoyant anticipation, according to the world's
notions, but age may have far brighter lights ahead
than youth had leisure to see. "I will hope always"
becomes sublime from aged lips, which are so often
shaped to say, "I have nothing left to hope for now."</p>

<p>This psalmist's words may well be a pattern for old
men, who need fear no failure of buoyancy, nor any
collapse of gladness, if they will fix their thoughts
where this singer did his. Other subjects of thought
and speech will pall and run dry; but he whose theme
is God's righteousness and the salvation that flows
from it will never lack materials for animating meditation
and grateful praise. "I know not the numbers
thereof." It is something to have fast hold of an
inexhaustible subject. It will keep an old man young.</p>

<p>The psalmist recognises his task, which is also his
joy, to declare God's wondrous works, and prays for
God's help till he has discharged it. The consciousness
of a vocation to speak to later generations
inspires him, and assures him that he is immortal till
his work is done. His anticipations have been fulfilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
beyond his knowledge. His words will last as long as
the world. But men with narrower spheres may be
animated by the same consciousness, and they who
have rightly understood the purpose of God's mercies
to themselves will, like the psalmist, recognise in their
own participation in His salvation an imperative
command to make it known, and an assurance that
nothing shall by any means harm them till they have
fulfilled their witnessing. A many-wintered saint should
be a convincing witness for God.</p>

<p>Ver. 20, with its sudden transition to the plural, may
simply show that the singer passes out from individual
contemplation to the consciousness of the multitude of
fellow-sufferers and fellow-participants in God's mercy.
Such transition is natural; for the most private passages
of a good man's communion with God are swift
to bring up the thought of others like-minded and
similarly blessed. "Suddenly there was with the
angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising."
Every solo swells into a chorus. Again the song
returns to "my" and "me," the confidence of the
single soul being reinvigorated by the thought of
sharers in blessing.</p>

<p>So all ends with the certainty of, and the vow of
praise for, deliverances already realised in faith, though
not in fact. But the imitative character of the psalm
is maintained even in this last triumphant vow; for
ver. 24 <i>a</i> is almost identical with xxxv. 28; and <i>b</i>, as has
been already pointed out, is copied from several other
psalms. But imitative words are none the less sincere;
and new thankfulness may be run into old moulds
without detriment to its acceptableness to God and
preciousness to men.</p>

<p>Rightly or wrongly, the superscription ascribes
this psalm to Solomon. Its contents have led
several commentators to take the superscription in a
meaning for which there is no warrant, as designating
the subject, not the author. Clearly, the whole is a
prayer for the king; but why should not he be both
suppliant and object of supplication? Modern critics
reject this as incompatible with the "phraseological
evidence," and adduce the difference between the
historical Solomon and the ideal of the psalm as
negativing reference to him. Ver. 8 is said by them to
be quoted from Zech. ix. 10, though Cheyne doubts
whether there is borrowing. Ver. 17 <i>b</i> is said to be
dependent on Gen. xxii. 18, xxvi. 4, which are assumed
to be later than the seventh century. Ver. 12 is taken
to be a reminiscence of Job xxix. 12, and ver. 16 <i>b</i>
of Job v. 25. But these are too uncertain criteria to
use as conclusive,&mdash;partly because coincidence does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
necessarily imply quotation; partly because, quotation
being admitted, the delicate question of priority remains,
which can rarely be settled by comparison of the
passages in question; and partly because, quotation and
priority being admitted, the date of the original is still
under discussion. The impossibility of Solomon's
praying thus for himself does not seem to the present
writer so completely established that the hypothesis
must be abandoned, especially if the alternative is to
be, as Hitzig, followed by Olshausen and Cheyne,
proposes, that the king in the psalm is Ptolemy Philadelphus,
to whom Psalm xlv. is fitted by the same
authorities. Baethgen puts the objections which most
will feel to such a theory with studied moderation when
he says "that the promises given to the patriarchs in
Gen. xxii. 18, xxvi. 4, should be transferred by a pious
Israelite to a foreign king appears to me improbable."
But another course is open&mdash;namely, to admit that the
psalm gives no materials for defining its date, beyond the
fact that a king of Davidic descent was reigning when
it was composed. The authorship may be left uncertain,
as may the name of the king for whom such far-reaching
blessings were invoked; for he was but a
partial embodiment of the kingly idea, and the very
disproportion between the reality seen in any Jewish
monarch and the lofty idealisms of the psalm compels us
to regard the earthly ruler as but a shadow, and the
true theme of the singer as being the Messianic King.
We are not justified, however, in attempting to transfer
every point of the psalmist's prayer to the Messiah.
The historical occasion of the psalm is to be kept in
mind. A human monarch stands in the foreground;
but the aspirations expressed are so far beyond anything
that he is or can be, that they are either extravagant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
flattery, or reach out beyond their immediate occasion
to the King Messiah.</p>

<p>The psalm is not properly a prediction, but a
prayer. There is some divergence of opinion as to
the proper rendering of the principal verbs,&mdash;some, as
the A.V. and R.V. (text), taking them as uniformly
futures, which is manifestly wrong; some taking them
as expressions of wish throughout, which is also
questionable; and others recognising pure futures
intermingled with petitions, which seems best. The
boundaries of the two are difficult to settle, just because
the petitions are so confident that they are all but
predictions, and the two melt into each other in the
singer's mind. The flow of thought is simple. The
psalmist's prayers are broadly massed. In vv. 1-4 he
prays for the foundation of the king's reign in righteousness,
which will bring peace; in vv. 5-7 for its
perpetuity, and in vv. 8-11 for its universality; while
in vv. 12-15 the ground of both these characteristics
is laid in the king's becoming the champion of the
oppressed. A final prayer for the increase of his
people and the perpetuity and world-wide glory of his
name concludes the psalm, to which are appended in
vv. 18-20 a doxology, closing the Second Book of the
Psalter.</p>

<p>The first petitions of the psalm all ask for one thing
for the king&mdash;namely, that he should give righteous
judgment. They reflect the antique conception of a
king as the fountain of justice, himself making and
administering law and giving decisions. Thrice in
these four verses does "righteousness" occur as the
foundation attribute of an ideal king. Caprice, self-interest,
and tyrannous injustice were rank in the
world's monarchies round the psalmist. Bitter experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
and sad observation had taught him that the first
condition of national prosperity was a righteous ruler.
These petitions are also animated by the conception,
which is as true in the modern as in the ancient world,
that righteousness has its seat in the bosom of God,
and that earthly judgments are righteous when they
conform to and are the echo of His. "Righteousness"
is the quality of mind, of which the several "judgments"
are the expressions. This king sits on an
ancestral throne. His people are God's people. Since,
then, he is God's viceroy, the desire cannot be vain
that in his heart there may be some reflection of God's
righteousness, and that his decisions may accord with
God's. One cannot but remember Solomon's prayer
for "an understanding heart," that he might judge this
people; nor forget how darkly his later reign showed
against its bright beginning. A righteous king makes
a peaceful people, especially in a despotic monarchy.
The sure results of such a reign&mdash;which are, likewise,
the psalmist's chief reason for his petitions&mdash;are set
forth in the vivid metaphor of ver. 3, in which peace is
regarded as the fruit which springs, by reason of the
king's righteousness, from mountains and hills. This
psalmist has special fondness for that figure of vegetable
growth (vv. 7, 16, 17); and it is especially suitable in
this connection, as peace is frequently represented in
Scripture as the fruit of righteousness, both in single
souls and in a nation's history. The mountains come
into view here simply as being the most prominent
features of the land, and not, as in ver. 16, with any
reference to their barrenness, which would make
abundant growth on them more wonderful, and indicative
of yet greater abundance on the plains.</p>

<p>A special manifestation of judicial righteousness is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the vindication of the oppressed and the punishment of
the oppressor (ver. 4). The word rendered "judge" in
ver. 4 differs from that in ver. 2, and is the same from
which the name of the "Judges" in Israel is derived.
Like them, this king is not only to pronounce decisions,
as the word in ver. 2 means, but is to execute justice
by acts of deliverance, which smite in order to rescue.
Functions which policy and dignity require to be kept
apart in the case of earthly rulers are united in the
ideal monarch. He executes his own sentences. His
acts are decisions. The psalmist has no thought of
inferior officers by the king's side. One figure fills
his mind and his canvas. Surely such an ideal is
either destined to remain for ever a fair dream, or its
fulfilment is to be recognised in the historical Person
in whom God's righteousness dwelt in higher fashion
than psalmists knew, who was, "first, King of
righteousness, and then, after that, also King of
peace," and who, by His deed, has broken every yoke,
and appeared as the defender of all the needy. The
poet prayed that Israel's king might perfectly discharge
his office by Divine help; the Christian gives thanks
that the King of men has been and done all which
Israel's monarchs failed to be and do.</p>

<p>The perpetuity of the king's reign and of his subjects'
peace is the psalmists second aspiration (vv. 5-7).
The "Thee" of ver. 5 presents a difficulty, as it is
doubtful to whom it refers. Throughout the psalm the
king is spoken <i>of</i>, and never <i>to</i>; and if it is further
noticed that, in the preceding verses, God has been
directly addressed, and "Thy" used thrice in regard to
Him, it will appear more natural to take the reference
in ver. 5 to be to Him. The fear of God would be
diffused among the king's subjects, as a consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
of his rule in righteousness. Hupfeld takes the word
as referring to the king, and suggests changing the
text to "him" instead of "Thee"; while others, among
whom are Cheyne and Baethgen, follow the track of
the LXX. in adopting a reading which may be translated
"May he live," or "Prolong his days." But
the thought yielded by the existing text, if referred to
God, is most natural and worthy. The king is, as
it were, the shadow on earth of God's righteousness,
and consequently becomes an organ for the manifestation
thereof, in such manner as to draw men to true
devotion. The psalmist's desires are for something
higher than external prosperity, and his conceptions
of the kingly office are very sacred. Not only peace
and material well-being, but also the fear of Jehovah,
are longed for by him to be diffused in Israel. And
he prays that these blessings may be perpetual. The
connection between the king's righteousness and the
fear of God requires that that permanence should
belong to both. The cause is as lasting as its effect.
Through generation after generation he desires that
each shall abide. He uses peculiar expressions for
continual duration: "with the sun"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, contemporaneous
with that unfading splendour; "before the
face of the moon"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, as long as she shines. But
could the singer anticipate such length of dominion
for any human king? Psalm xxi. has similar language
in regard to the same person; and here, as there,
it seems sufficiently accounted for by the consideration
that, while the psalmist was speaking of an
individual, he was thinking of the office rather than of
the person, and that the perpetual continuance of the
Davidic dynasty, not the undying life of any one
representative of it, was meant. The full light of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
truth that there is a king whose royalty, like his priesthood,
passes to no other is not to be forced upon the
psalm. It stands as a witness that devout and inspired
souls longed for the establishment of a kingdom,
against which revolutions and enemies and mortality
were powerless. They knew not that their desires
could not be fulfilled by the longest succession of dying
kings, but were to be more than accomplished by One,
"of whom it is witnessed that He liveth."</p>

<p>The psalmist turns for a moment from his prayer
for the perpetuity of the king's rule, to linger upon the
thought of its blessedness as set forth in the lovely
image of ver. 6. Rain upon mown grass is no blessing,
as every farmer knows; but what is meant is, not the
grass which has already been mown, but the naked
meadow from which it has been taken. It needs
drenching showers, in order to sprout again and produce
an aftermath. The poet's eye is caught by the
contrast between the bare look of the field immediately
after cutting and the rich growth that springs, as by
magic, from the yellow roots after a plentiful shower.
This king's gracious influences shall fall upon even
what seems dead, and charm forth hidden life that
will flush the plain with greenness. The psalmist
dwells on the picture, reiterating the comparison in
ver. 6 <i>b</i>, and using there an uncommon word, which
seems best rendered as meaning a heavy rainfall.
With such affluence of quickening powers will the
righteous king bless his people. The "Mirror for
Magistrates," which is held up in the lovely poem
in 2 Sam. xxiii. 4, has a remarkable parallel in its
description of the just ruler as resembling a "morning
without clouds, when the tender grass springeth out
of the earth through clear shining after rain"; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
psalmist heightens the metaphor by the introduction
of the mown meadow as stimulated to new growth.
This image of the rain lingers with him and shapes
his prayer in ver. 7 <i>a</i>. A righteous king will insure
prosperity to the righteous, and the number of such
will increase. Both these ideas seem to be contained
in the figure of their flourishing, which is literally <i>bud</i>
or <i>shoot</i>. And, as the people become more and more
prevailingly righteous, they receive more abundant and
unbroken peace. The psalmist had seen deeply into
the conditions of national prosperity, as well as those of
individual tranquillity, when he based these on rectitude.</p>

<p>With ver. 8 the singer takes a still loftier flight, and
prays for the universality of the king's dominion. In
that verse the form of the verb is that which expresses
desire, but in ver. 9 and following verses the verbs
may be rendered as simple futures. Confident prayers
insensibly melt into assurances of their own fulfilment.
As the psalmist pours out his petitions, they glide into
prophecies; for they are desires fashioned upon promises,
and bear, in their very earnestness, the pledge of their
realisation. As to the details of the form which the
expectation of universal dominion here takes, it need
only be noted that we have to do with a poet, not with
a geographer. We are not to treat the expressions
as if they were instructions to a boundary commission,
and to be laid down upon a map. "The sea" is probably
the Mediterranean; but what the other sea which
makes the opposite boundary may be is hard to say.
Commentators have thought of the Persian Gulf, or of
an imaginary ocean encircling the flat earth, according
to ancient ideas. But more probably the expression
is as indeterminate as the parallel one, "the ends of the
earth." In the first clause of the verse the psalmist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
starts from the Mediterranean, the western boundary,
and his anticipations travel away into the unknown
eastern regions; while, in the second clause, he begins
with the Euphrates, which was the eastern boundary
of the dominion promised to Israel, and, coming westward,
he passes out in thought to the dim regions
beyond. The very impossibility of defining the boundaries
declares the boundlessness of the kingdom. The
poet's eyes have looked east and west, and in ver. 9 he
turns to the south, and sees the desert tribes, unconquered
as they have hitherto been, grovelling before
the king, and his enemies in abject submission at his
feet. The word rendered "desert peoples" is that used
in Psalm lxxiv. 14 for wild beasts inhabiting the desert,
but here it can only mean <i>wilderness tribes</i>. There
seems no need to alter the text, as has been proposed,
and to read "adversaries." In ver. 10 the psalmist
again looks westward, across the mysterious ocean of
which he, like all his nation, knew so little. The great
city of Tarshish lay for him at the farthest bounds of
the world; and between him and it, or perhaps still
farther out in the waste unknown, were islands from
which rich and strange things sometimes reached Judæa.
These shall bring their wealth in token of fealty.
Again he looks southward to Sheba in Arabia, and
Seba far south below Egypt, and foresees their submission.
His knowledge of distant lands is exhausted,
and therefore he ceases enumeration, and falls back
on comprehensiveness. How little he knew, and how
much he believed! His conceptions of the sweep of
that "all" were childish; his faith that, however many
these unknown kings and nations were, God's anointed
was their king was either extravagant exaggeration,
or it was nurtured in him by God, and meant to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
fulfilled when a world, wide beyond his dreams and
needy beyond his imagination, should own the sway of
a King, endowed with God's righteousness and communicative
of God's peace, in a manner and measure
beyond his desires.</p>

<p>The triumphant swell of these anticipations passes
with wonderful pathos into gentler music, as if the
softer tones of flutes should follow trumpet blasts.
How tenderly and profoundly the psalm bases the
universality of the dominion on the pitying care and
delivering power of the King! The whole secret of
sway over men lies in that "For," which ushers in the
gracious picture of the beneficent and tender-hearted
Monarch. The world is so full of sorrow, and men are
so miserable and needy, that he who can stanch their
wounds, solace their griefs, and shelter their lives will
win their hearts and be crowned their king. Thrones
based on force are as if set on an iceberg which melts
away. There is no solid foundation for rule except
helpfulness. In the world and for a little while "they
that exercise authority are called benefactors"; but in
the long-run the terms of the sentence are inverted,
and they that are rightly called benefactors exercise
authority. The more earthly rulers approximate to this
ideal portrait, the more "broad-based upon their people's
will" and love will their thrones stand. If Israel's
kings had adhered to it, their throne would have
endured. But their failures point to Him in whom the
principle declared by the psalmist receives its most
tender illustration. The universal dominion of Jesus
Christ is based upon the fact that He "tasted death
for every man." In the Divine purpose, He has won
the right to rule men because He has died for them.
In historical realisation, He wins men's submission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
because He has given Himself for them. Therefore
does He command with absolute authority; therefore
do we obey with entire submission. His sway not
only reaches out over all the earth, inasmuch as the
power of His cross extends to all men, but it lays hold
of the inmost will and makes submission a delight.</p>

<p>The king is represented in ver. 14 as taking on
himself the office of Goel, or Kinsman-Redeemer, and
ransoming his subjects' lives from "deceit and violence."
That "their blood is precious in his eyes" is another
way of saying that they are too dear to him to be
suffered to perish. This king's treasure is the life of
his subjects. Therefore he will put forth his power
to preserve them and deliver them. The result of
such tender care and delivering love is set forth in
ver. 15, but in obscure language. The ambiguity arises
from the absence of expressed subjects for the four
verbs in the verse. Who is he who "lives"? Is the
same person the giver of the gold of Sheba, and to
whom is it given? Who prays, and for whom? And
who blesses, and whom does he bless? The plain
way of understanding the verse is to suppose that the
person spoken of in all the clauses is the same; and
then the question comes whether he is the king or the
ransomed man. Difficulties arise in carrying out either
reference through all the clauses; and hence attempts
have been made to vary the subject of the verbs.
Delitzsch, for instance, supposes that it is the ransomed
man who "lives," the king who gives to the ransomed
man gold, and the man who prays for and blesses the
king. But such an arbitrary shuttling about of the
reference of "he" and "him" is impossible. Other
attempts of a similar kind need not be noticed here.
The only satisfactory course is to take one person as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
spoken of by all the verbs. But then the question comes,
Who is he? There is much to be said in favour of
either hypothesis as answering that question. The
phrase which is rendered above "So that he lives"
is so like the common invocation "May the king live,"
that it strongly favours taking the whole verse as a
continuance of the petitions for the monarch. But if
so, the verb in the second clause (<i>he shall give</i>) must
be taken impersonally, as equivalent to "one will give"
or "there shall be given," and those in the remaining
clauses must be similarly dealt with, or the text
altered so as to make them plurals, reading, "They
shall pray for him (the king), ... and shall bless him."
On the whole, it is best to suppose that the ransomed
man is the subject throughout, and that the verse
describes his glad tribute, and continual thankfulness.
Ransomed from death, he brings offerings to his
deliverer. It seems singular that he should be conceived
of both as "needy" and as owning "gold"
which he can offer; but in the literal application the
incongruity is not sufficient to prevent the adoption of
this view of the clause; and in the higher application
of the words to Christ and His subjects, which we
conceive to be warranted, the incongruity becomes fine
and deep truth; for the poorest soul, delivered by Him,
can bring tribute, which He esteems as precious beyond
all earthly treasure. Nor need the remaining clauses
militate against the view that the ransomed man is the
subject in them. The psalm had a historical basis, and
all its points cannot be introduced into the Messianic
interpretation. This one of praying for the king
cannot be; notwithstanding the attempts of some commentators
to find a meaning for it in Christian prayers
for the spread of Christ's kingdom. That explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
does violence to the language, mistakes the nature of
Messianic prophecy, and brings discredit on the view
that the psalm has a Messianic character.</p>

<p>The last part of the psalm (vv. 16, 17) recurs to
petitions for the growth of the nation and the perpetual
flourishing of the king's name. The fertility of the
land and the increase of its people are the psalmist's
desires, which are also certainties, as expressed in
ver. 16. He sees in imagination the whole land
waving with abundant harvests, which reach even to
the tops of the mountains, and rustle in the summer
air, with a sound like the cedars of Lebanon, when they
move their layers of greenness to the breeze. The
word rendered above "abundance" is doubtful; but
there does not seem to be in the psalmist's mind the
contrast which he is often supposed to be expressing,
beautiful and true as it, is between the small beginnings
and the magnificent end of the kingdom on earth.
The mountains are here thought of as lofty and barren.
If waving harvests clothe their gaunt sides, how will
the vales laugh in plentiful crops! As the earth
yields her increase, so the people of the king shall be
multiplied, and from all his cities they shall spring
forth abundant as grass. That figure would bear
much expansion; for what could more beautifully set
forth rapidity of growth, close-knit community, multiplication
of units, and absorption of these in a lovely
whole, than the picture of a meadow clothed with its
grassy carpet? Such hopes had only partial fulfilment
in Israel. Nor have they had adequate fulfilment up
till now. But they lie on the horizon of the future,
and they shall one day be reached. Much that is dim
is treasured in them. There may be a renovated world,
from which the curse of barrenness has been banished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
There shall be a swift increase of the subjects of the
King, until the earlier hope of the psalm is fulfilled,
and all nations shall serve Him.</p>

<p>But bright as are the poet's visions concerning the
kingdom, his last gaze is fastened on its king, and he
prays that his name may last for ever, and may send
forth shoots as long as the sun shines in the sky. He
probably meant no more than a prayer for the continual
duration of the dynasty, and his conception of the name
as sending forth shoots was probably that of its being
perpetuated in descendants. But, as has been already
noticed, the perpetuity, which he conceived of as belonging
to a family and an office, really belongs to the One
King, Jesus Christ, whose Name is above every name,
and will blossom anew in fresh revelations of its infinite
contents, not only while the sun shines, but when its
fires are cold and its light quenched. The psalmist's
last desire is that the ancient promise to the fathers
may be fulfilled in the King, their descendant, in whom
men shall bless themselves. So full of blessedness
may He seem to all men, that they shall take Him for
the very type of felicity, and desire to be even as He
is! In men's relation to Christ the phrase assumes a
deeper meaning still; and though that is not intended
by the psalmist, and is not the exposition of his words,
it still is true that in Christ all blessings for humanity
are stored, and that therefore if men are to be truly
blessed they must plunge themselves into Him, and in
Him find all that they need for blessedness and nobility
of life and character. If He is our supreme type of
whatsoever things are fair and of good report, and if
we have bowed ourselves to Him because He has
delivered us from death, then we share in His life,
and all His blessings are parted among us.</p>

<p>The perennial problem of reconciling God's moral
government with observed facts is grappled with
in this psalm, as in Psalms xxxvii. and xlix. It tells
how the prosperity of the godless, in apparent flat
contradiction of Divine promises, had all but swept the
psalmist from his faith, and how he was led, through
doubt and struggle, to closer communion with God,
in which he learned, not only the evanescence of the
external well-being which had so perplexed him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
the eternity of the true blessedness belonging to the
godly. His solution of the problem is in part that of
the two psalms just mentioned, but it surpasses them
in its clear recognition that the portion of the righteous,
which makes their lot supremely blessed, is no
mere earthly prosperity, but God Himself, and in its
pointing to "glory" which comes afterwards, as one
element in the solution of the problem.</p>

<p>The psalm falls into two divisions, in the first of
which (vv. 1-14) the psalmist tells of his doubts, and, in
the second (vv. 15-28), of his victory over them. The
body of the psalm is divided into groups of four
verses, and it has an introduction and conclusion of
two verses each.</p>

<p>The introduction (vv. 1, 2) asserts, with an accent of
assurance, the conviction which the psalmist had all
but lost, and therefore had the more truly won. The
initial word "Surely" is an indication of his past
struggle, when the truth that God was good to Israel
had seemed so questionable. "This I have learned
by doubts; this I now hold as most sure; this I proclaim,
impugn it who list, and seem to contradict it
what may." The decisiveness of the psalmist's conviction
does not lead him to exaggeration. He does
not commit himself to the thesis that outward prosperity
attends Israel. That God is good to those who
truly bear that name is certain; but how He shows His
goodness, and who these are, the psalmist has, by his
struggles, learned to conceive of in a more spiritual
fashion than before. That goodness may be plainly
seen in sorrows, and it is only sealed to those who are
what the name of Israel imports&mdash;"pure in heart."
That such are blessed in possessing God, and that
neither are any other blessed, nor is there any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
blessedness, are the lessons which the singer has
brought with him from the darkness, and by which
the ancient faith of the well-being of the righteous is
set on surer foundations than before.</p>

<p>The avowal of conquered doubts follows on this
clear note of certitude. There is a tinge of shame in
the emphatic "I" of ver. 2, and in the broken construction
and the change of subject to "my feet" and
"my steps." The psalmist looks back to that dreary
time, and sees more clearly than he did, while he was
caught in the toils of perplexity and doubt, how narrow
had been his escape from casting away his confidence.
He shudders as he remembers it; but he can do so
now from the vantage-ground of tried and regained
faith. How eloquently the order of thought in these
two verses speaks of the complete triumph over doubt!</p>

<p>In the first quatrain of verses, the prosperity of the
godless, which had been the psalmist's stumbling-block,
is described. Two things are specified&mdash;physical
health, and exemption from calamity. The
former is the theme of ver. 4. Its first clause is
doubtful. The word rendered "bands" only occurs
here and in Isa. lviii. 6. It literally means bands,
but may pass into the figurative signification of pains,
and is sometimes by some taken in that meaning here,
and the whole clause as asserting that the wicked have
painless and peaceful deaths. But such a declaration
is impossible in the face of vv. 18, 19, which assert
the very opposite, and would be out of place at this
point of the psalm, which is here occupied with the
lives, not the deaths, of the ungodly. Hupfeld translates
"They are without pains even until their deaths"; but
that rendering puts an unusual sense on the preposition
"to," which is not "till." A very plausible conjecture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
alters the division of words, splitting the one which
means "to their death" (<i>l'motham</i>) into two (<i>lamo
tam</i>), of which the former is attached to the preceding
words ("there are no pains <i>to them</i>" = "they have no
pains"), and the latter to the following clause ("<i>Sound</i>
and well nourished is," etc.). This suggestion is
adopted by Ewald and most modern commentators, and
has much in its favour. If the existing text is retained,
the rendering above seems best. It describes the prosperous
worldling as free from troubles or diseases,
which would be like chains on a captive, by which he
is dragged to execution. It thus gives a parallel to
the next clause, which describes their bodies (lit.,
belly) as stalwart. Ver. 5 carries on the description,
and paints the wicked's exemption from trouble. The
first clause is literally, "In the trouble of man they
are not." The word for man here is that which connotes
frailty and mortality, while in the next clause
it is the generic term "Adam." Thus the prosperous
worldlings appeared to the psalmist, in his times of
scepticism, as possessing charmed lives, which were
free from all the ills that came from frailty and
mortality, and, as like superior beings, lifted above
the universal lot. But what did their exemption do
for them? Its effects might have taught the doubter
that the prosperity at which his faith staggered was
no blessing, for it only inflated its recipients with pride,
and urged them on to high-handed acts. Very graphically
does ver. 6 paint them as having the former for
their necklace, and the latter for their robe. A proud
man carries a stiff neck and a high head. Hence the
picture in ver. 6 of "pride" as wreathed about their
necks as a chain or necklace. High-handed violence
is their garment, according to the familiar metaphor by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
which a man's characteristics are likened to his dress,
the garb of his soul. The double meaning of "habit,"
and the connection between "custom" and "costume,"
suggest the same figure. As the clothing wraps the
body and is visible to the world, so insolent violence,
masterfulness enforced by material weapons and contemptuous
of others' rights, characterised these men,
who had never learned gentleness in the school of
suffering. Tricked out with a necklace of pride and
a robe of violence, they strutted among men, and
thought themselves far above the herd, and secure from
the touch of trouble.</p>

<p>The next group of verses (vv. 7-10) further describes
the unfeeling insolence begotten of unbroken prosperity,
and the crowd of hangers-on, admirers, and imitators
attendant on the successful wicked. "Out of fat
their eye flashes" gives a graphic picture of the fierce
glare of insolent eyes, set in well-fed faces. But
graphic as it is, it scarcely fits the context so well
as does a proposed amended reading, which by a very
small change in the word rendered "their eye" yields
the meaning "their iniquity," and takes "fat" as
equivalent to a fat, that is, an obstinate, self-confident,
or unfeeling heart. "From an unfeeling heart their
iniquity comes forth" makes a perfect parallel with
the second clause of the verse rightly rendered, "the
imaginations of their heart overflow"; and both clauses
paint the arrogant tempers and bearing of the worldlings.
Ver. 8 deals with the manifestation of these in speech.
Well-to-do wickedness delights in making suffering
goodness a butt for its coarse jeers. It does not need
much wit to do that. Clumsy jests are easy, and poverty
is fair game for vulgar wealth's ridicule. But there
is a dash of ferocity in such laughter, and such jests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
pass quickly into earnest, and wicked oppression. "As
from on high they speak,"&mdash;fancying themselves set
on a pedestal above the common masses. The LXX.,
followed by many moderns, attaches "oppression" to the
second clause, which makes the verse more symmetrical;
but the existing division of clauses yields an appropriate
sense.</p>

<p>The description of arrogant speech is carried on
in ver. 9, which has been variously understood, as
referring in <i>a</i> to blasphemy against God ("they set
against the heavens their mouth"), and in <i>b</i> to slander
against men; or, as in <i>a</i>, continuing the thought of
ver. 8 <i>b</i>, and designating their words as spoken as if
from heaven itself, and in <i>b</i> ascribing to their words
sovereign power among men. But it is better to regard
"heaven" and "earth" as the ordinary designation
of the whole visible frame of things, and to take the
verse as describing the self-sufficiency which gives its
opinions and lays down the law about everything, and,
on the other hand, the currency and influence which
are accorded by the popular voice to the dicta of
prosperous worldlings.</p>

<p>That thought prepares the way for the enigmatic
verse which follows. There are several obscure points
in it. First, the verb in the Hebrew text means <i>turns</i>
(transitive), which the Hebrew margin corrects into
<i>returns</i> (intransitive). With the former reading, "his
people" is the object of the verb, and the implied subject
is the prosperous wicked man, the change to the singular
"he" from the plural "they" of the preceding clauses
being not unusual in Hebrew. With the latter reading,
"his people" is the subject. The next question is to
whom the "people" are conceived as belonging. It is,
at first sight, natural to think of the frequent Scripture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
expression, and to take the "his" as referring to God,
and the phrase to mean the true Israel. But the
meaning seems rather to be the mob of parasites and
hangers-on, who servilely follow the successful sinner,
in hope of some crumbs from his table. "Thither"
means "to himself," and the whole describes how such
a one as the man whose portrait has just been drawn
is sure to attract a retinue of dependants, who say
as he says, and would fain be what he is. The last
clause describes the share of these parasites in their
patron's prosperity. "Waters of abundance"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
abundant waters&mdash;may be an emblem of the pernicious
principles of the wicked, which their followers swallow
greedily; but it is more probably a figure for fulness
of material good, which rewards the humiliation of
servile adherents to the prosperous worldling.</p>

<p>The next group (vv. 11-14) begins with an utterance
of unbelief or doubt, but it is difficult to reach
certainty as to the speakers. It is very natural to
refer the "they" to the last-mentioned persons&mdash;namely,
the people who have been led to attach themselves to
the prosperous sinners, and who, by the example of
these, are led to question the reality of God's acquaintance
with and moral government of human affairs.
The question is, as often, in reality a denial. But
"they" may have a more general sense, equivalent to
our own colloquial use of it for an indefinite multitude.
"They say"&mdash;that is, "the common opinion and rumour
is." So here, the meaning may be, that the sight of
such flushed and flourishing wickedness diffuses widespread
and deep-going doubts of God's knowledge, and
makes many infidels.</p>

<p>Ewald, Delitzsch, and others take all the verses of
this group as spoken by the followers of the ungodly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
and, unquestionably, that view avoids the difficulty of
allotting the parts to different unnamed interlocutors.
But it raises difficulties of another kind&mdash;as, for instance,
those of supposing that these adulators should roundly
call their patrons wicked, and that an apostate should
profess that he has cleansed his heart. The same
objections do not hold against the view that these four
verses are the utterance, not of the wicked rich man
or his coterie of admirers, but of the wider number
whose faith has been shaken. There is nothing in the
verses which would be unnatural on such lips.</p>

<p>Ver. 11 would then be a question anxiously raised
by faith that was beginning to reel; ver. 12 would
be a statement of the anomalous fact which staggered
it; and vv. 13, 14, the complaint of the afflicted godly.
The psalmist's repudiation of a share in such incipient
scepticism would begin with ver. 15. There is much
in favour of this view of the speakers, but against it
is the psalmist's acknowledgment, in ver. 2, that his
own confidence in God's moral government had been
shaken, of which there is no further trace in the psalm,
unless vv. 13, 14, express the conclusion which he had
been tempted to draw, and which, as he proceeds to
say, he had fought down. If these two verses are
ascribed to him, ver. 12 is best regarded as a summary
of the whole preceding part, and only ver. 11 as
the utterance either of the prosperous sinner and his
adherents (in which case it is a question which means
denial), or as that of troubled faith (in which case it
is a question that would fain be an affirmation, but has
been forced unwillingly to regard the very pillars of
the universe as trembling).</p>

<p>Vv. 15-18 tell how the psalmist strove with and
finally conquered his doubts, and saw enough of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
great arc of the Divine dealings, to be sure that the
anomaly, which had exercised his faith, was capable of
complete reconciliation with the righteousness of Providence.
It is instructive to note that he silenced his
doubts, out of regard to "the generation of Thy
children"&mdash;that is, to the true Israel, the pure in heart.
He was tempted to speak as others did not fear to
speak, impugning God's justice and proclaiming the
uselessness of purity; but he locked his lips, lest his
words should prove him untrue to the consideration
which he owed to meek and simple hearts, who knew
nothing of the speculative difficulties torturing him.
He does not say that his speaking would have been
sin against God. It would not have been so, if, in
speaking, he had longed for confirmation of his wavering
faith. But whatever the motive of his words,
they might have shaken some lowly believers. Therefore
he resolved on silence. Like all wise and devout
men, he swallowed his own smoke, and let the process
of doubting go on to its end of certainty, one way or
another, before he spoke. This psalm, in which he tells
how he overcame them, is his first acknowledgment
that he had had these temptations to cast away his
confidence. Fermentation should be done in the dark.
When the process is finished, and the product is clear,
it is fit to be produced and drank. Certitudes are meant
to be uttered; doubts are meant to be struggled with.
The psalmist has set an example which many men
need to ponder to-day. It is easy, and it is also cruel,
to raise questions which the proposer is not ready to
answer.</p>

<p>Silent brooding over his problem did not bring light,
as ver. 16 tells us. The more he thought over it, the
more insoluble did it seem to him. There are chambers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
which the key of thinking will not open. Unwelcome
as the lesson is, we have to learn that every lock will
not yield to even prolonged and strenuous investigation.
The lamp of the Understanding throws its beams far,
but there are depths of darkness too deep and dark
for them; and they are wisest who know its limits
and do not try to use it in regions where it is useless.</p>

<p>But faith finds a path where speculation discerns none.
The psalmist "went into the sanctuary (literally, sanctuaries)
of God," and there light streamed in on him,
in which he saw light. Not mere entrance into the
place of worship, but closer approach to the God who
dwelt there, cleared away the mists. Communion with
God solves many problems which thinking leaves unresolved.
The eye which has gazed on God is purged
for much vision besides. The disproportion between
the deserts and fortunes of good and bad men assumes
an altogether different aspect when contemplated in
the light of present communion with Him, which brings
a blessedness that makes earthly prosperity seem dross,
and earthly burdens seem feathers. Such communion,
in its seclusion from worldly agitations, enables a man
to take calmer, saner views of life, and in its enduring
blessedness reveals more clearly the transiency of the
creatural good which deceives men with the figment of
its permanence. The lesson which the psalmist learned
in the solemn stillness of the sanctuary was the end
of ungodly prosperity. That changes the aspect of the
envied position of the prosperous sinner, for his very
prosperity is seen to contribute to his downfall, as
well as to make that downfall more tragic by contrast.
His sure footing, exempt as he seemed from the
troubles and ills that flesh is heir to, was really on
a treacherous slope, like smooth sheets of rock on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
mountain-side. To stand on them is to slide down to
hideous ruin.</p>

<p>The theme of the end of the prosperous sinners is
continued in the next group (vv. 19-22). In ver. 19
the psalmist seems as if standing an amazed spectator
of the crash, which tumbles into chaos the solid-seeming
fabric of their insolent prosperity. An exclamation
breaks from his lips as he looks. And then destruction
is foretold for all such, under the solemn and magnificent
image of ver. 20. God has seemed to sleep,
letting evil run its course; but He "rouses Himself"&mdash;that
is, comes forth in judicial acts&mdash;and as a dreamer
remembers his dream, which seemed so real, and smiles
at its imaginary terrors or joys, so He will "despise"
them, as no more solid nor lasting than phantasms of the
night. The end contemplated by the psalmist is not
necessarily death, but any sudden overthrow, of which
there are many in the experience of the godless. Life
is full of such awakings of God, both in regard to
individuals and nations, which, if a man duly regards,
he will find the problem of the psalm less insoluble
than at first it appears. But if there are lives which,
being without goodness, are also without chastisement,
Death comes at last to such as God's awaking, and a
very awful dissipating of earthly prosperity into a
shadowy nothing.</p>

<p>The psalmist has no revelation here of future retribution.
His vindication of God's justice is not based
on that, but simply on the transiency of worldly
prosperity, and on its dangerous character. It is "a
slippery place," and it is sure to come to an end. It
is obvious that there are many other considerations
which have to be taken into account, in order to a
complete solution of the problem of the psalm. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
the psalmist's solution goes far to lighten the painful
perplexity of it; and if we add his succeeding thoughts
as to the elements of true blessedness, we have solution
enough for peaceful acquiescence, if not for entire
understanding. The psalmist's way of finding an
answer is even more valuable than the answer which
he found. They who dwell in the secret place of the
Most High can look on the riddle of this painful world
with equanimity, and be content to leave it half
unsolved.</p>

<p>Vv. 21, 22, are generally taken as one sentence,
and translated as by Delitzsch, "If my heart should
grow bitter ... I should be brutish," etc.; or, as by
Hupfeld, "When my heart grew bitter ... then I was
as a beast," etc.; but they are better regarded as the
psalmist's penitent explanation of his struggle. "Unbelieving
thoughts had fermented in his mind, and a
pang of passionate discontent had pierced his inmost
being. But the higher self blames the lower self for
such folly" (Cheyne, <i>in loc.</i>). His recognition that his
doubts had their source, not in defect in God's providence,
but in his own ignorance and hasty irritation,
which took offence without cause, prepares him for the
sweet, clear note of purely spiritual aspiration and
fruition which follows in the next strophe.</p>

<p>He had all but lost his hold of God; but though
his feet had almost gone astray, his hand had been
grasped by God, and that strong hold had kept him
from utterly falling. The pledge of continual communion
with God is not our own vacillating, wayward
hearts, but God's gentle, strong clasp, which will not
let us go. Thus conscious of constant fellowship, and
feeling thrillingly God's touch in his inmost spirit, the
psalmist rises to a height of joyous assurance, far above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
doubts and perplexities caused by the unequal distribution
of earth's trivial good. For him, all life will
be illumined by God's counsel, which will guide him
as a shepherd leads his sheep, and which he will obey
as a sheep follows his shepherd. How small the
delights of the prosperous men seem now! And can
there be an end to that sweet alliance, such as smites
earthly good? There are blessings which bear in
themselves assurance of their own undyingness; and
this psalmist, who had nothing to say of the future
retribution falling on the sinner whose delights were
confined to earth, feels that death cannot put a period
to a union so blessed and spiritual as was his with
God. To him, "afterwards" was irradiated with light
from present blessedness; and a solemnly joyful conviction
springs in his soul, which he casts into words
that glance at the story of Enoch's translation, from
which "take" is quoted (<i>cf.</i> Psalm xlix. 16). Whether
we translate "with glory" or "to glory," there can be
no question that the psalmist is looking beyond life
on earth to dwelling with God in glory. We have,
in this utterance, the expression of the conviction, inseparable
from any true, deep communion with God,
that such communion can never be at the mercy of
Death. The real proof of a life beyond the grave
is the resurrection of Jesus; and the pledge of it is
present enjoyment of fellowship with God.</p>

<p>Such thoughts lift the psalmist to a height from
which earth's troubles show small, and as they
diminish, the perplexity arising from their distribution
diminishes in proportion. They fade away altogether,
when he feels how rich he is in possessing God. Surely
the very summit of devotional rapture is reached in
the immortal words which follow! Heaven without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
God were a waste to this man. With God, he needs
not nor desires anything on earth. If the impossible
should be actual, and heart as well as flesh should fail,
his naked self would be clothed and rich, steadfast and
secure, as long as he had God; and he is so closely
knit to God, that he knows that he will not lose Him
though he dies, but have Him for his very own for ever.
What care need he have how earth's vain goods come
and go? Whatever outward calamities or poverty may
be his lot, there is no riddle in that Divine government
which thus enriches the devout heart; and the richest
ungodly man is poor, because he shuts himself out
from the one all-sufficient and enduring wealth.</p>

<p>A final pair of verses, answering to the introductory
pair, gathers up the double truth, which the psalmist
has learned to grasp more firmly by occasion of his
doubts. To be absent from God is to perish. Distance
from Him is separation from life. Drawing near to
Him is the only good; and the psalmist has deliberately
chosen it as <i>his</i> good, let worldly prosperity come or
go as it list, or, rather, as God shall choose. By the
effort of his own volition he has made God his refuge,
and, safe in Him, he can bear the sorrows of the godly,
and look unenvying on the fleeting prosperity of sinners,
while, with insight drawn from communion, he can
recount with faith and praise all God's works, and
find in none of them a stumbling-block, nor fail to find
in any of them material for a song of thankfulness.</p>

<p>Two periods only correspond to the circumstances
described in this psalm and its companion (lxxix.)&mdash;namely,
the Chaldean invasion and sack of Jerusalem,
and the persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes. The
general situation outlined in the psalm fits either of
these; but, of its details, some are more applicable to
the former and others to the later period. The later
date is strongly supported by such complaints as those
of the cessation of prophecy (ver. 9), the flaunting of
the invaders' signs in the sanctuary (ver. 4), and the
destruction by fire of all the "meeting-places of God in
the land" (ver. 8). On the other hand, the earlier date
better fits other features of the psalm&mdash;since Antiochus
did not destroy or burn, but simply profaned the Temple,
though he did, indeed, set fire to the gates and porch,
but to these only. It would appear that, on either
hypothesis, something must be allowed for poetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
colouring. Calvin, whom Cheyne follows in this,
accounts for the introduction of the burning of the
Temple into a psalm referring to the desolation wrought
by Antiochus, by the supposition that the psalmist
speaks in the name of the "faithful, who, looking on
the horrid devastation of the Temple, and being warned
by so sad a sight, carried back their thoughts to that
conflagration by which it had been destroyed by the
Chaldeans, and wove the two calamities together into
one." It is less difficult to pare down the statement
as to the burning of the Temple so as to suit the
later date, than that as to the silence of prophecy and
the other characteristics mentioned, so as to fit the
earlier. The question is still further complicated by
the similarities between the two psalms and Jeremiah
(compare ver. 4 with Lam. ii. 7, and ver. 9 with
Lam. ii. 9). The prophet's well-known fondness
for quotations gives probability, other things being
equal, to the supposition that he is quoting the psalm,
which would, in that case, be older than Lamentations.
But this inference scarcely holds good, if there are
other grounds on which the later date of the psalm is
established. It would be very natural in a singer of
the Maccabean period to go back to the prophet whose
sad strains had risen at another black hour. On the
whole, the balance is in favour of the later date.</p>

<p>The psalm begins with a complaining cry to God
(vv. 1-3), which passes into a piteous detail of the
nation's misery (vv. 4-9), whence it rises into petition
(vv. 10, 11), stays trembling faith by gazing upon His
past deeds of help and the wonders of His creative
power (vv. 12-17), and closes with beseeching God to
vindicate the honour of His own name by the deliverance
of His people (vv. 18-23).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>The main emphasis of the prayer in vv. 1-3 lies on
the pleas which it presents, drawn from Israel's relation
to God. The characteristic Asaphic name "Thy flock"
stands in ver. 1, and appeals to the Shepherd, both
on the ground of His tenderness and of His honour as
involved in the security of the sheep. A similar appeal
lies in the two words "acquire" and "redeem," in both
of which the deliverance from Egypt is referred to,&mdash;the
former expression suggesting the price at which the
acquisition was made, as well as the obligations of
ownership; and the latter, the office of the Goel, the
Kinsman-Redeemer, on whom devolved the duty of
obtaining satisfaction for blood. The double designations
of Israel as "Thy congregation" and as "the
tribe of Thine inheritance" probably point to the
religious and civil aspects of the national life. The
strongest plea is put last&mdash;namely, God's dwelling on
Zion. For all these reasons, the psalmist asks and
expects Him to come with swift footsteps to the desolations,
which have endured so long that the impatience
of despair blends with the cry for help, and calls them
"everlasting," even while it prays that they may be
built up again. The fact that the enemy of God and of
His flock has marred everything <i>in the sanctuary</i> is
enough, the psalmist thinks, to move God to action.</p>

<p>The same thought, that the nation's calamities are
really dishonouring to God, and therefore worthy of
His intervention, colours the whole of the description
of these in vv. 4-9. The invaders are "<i>Thine</i> adversaries."
It is "in the place where <i>Thou</i> didst meet us"
that their bestial noises, like those of lions over their
prey, echo. It is "<i>Thy</i> sanctuary" which they have
set on fire, "the dwelling-place of <i>Thy</i> name" which
they have profaned. It is "<i>Thy</i> meeting-places" which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
they have burned throughout the land. Only at the
end of the sad catalogue is the misery of the people
touched on, and that, not so much as inflicted by human
foes, as by the withdrawal of God's Spirit. This is,
in fact, the dominant thought of the whole psalm. It
says very little about the sufferings resulting from the
success of the enemy, but constantly recurs to the
insult to God, and the reproach adhering to His name
therefrom. The essence of it all is in the concluding
prayer, "Plead <i>Thine own</i> cause" (ver. 22).</p>

<p>The vivid description of devastation in these verses
presents some difficulties in detail, which call for brief
treatment. The "signs" in ver. 4 <i>b</i> may be taken as
military, such as banners or the like; but it is more in
accordance with the usage of the word to suppose them
to be religious emblems, or possibly idols, such as
Antiochus thrust upon the Jews. In vv. 5 and 6 a
change of tense represents the action described in them,
as if in progress at the moment before the singer's
eyes. "They seem" is literally "He is known" (or
<i>makes himself known</i>), which may refer to the invaders,
the change from plural to singular being frequent in
Hebrew; or it may be taken impersonally, = "It seems."
In either case it introduces a comparison between the
hacking and hewing by the spoilers in the Temple, and
the work of a woodman swinging on high his axe in
the forest. "And now" seems to indicate the next
step in the scene; which the psalmist picturesquely
conceives as passing before his horror-stricken sight.
The end of that ill-omened activity is that at last it
succeeds in shattering the carved work, which, in the
absence of statues, was the chief artistic glory of the
Temple. All is hewed down, as if it were no more
than so much growing timber. With ver. 7 the tenses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
change to the calmer tone of historical narration. The
plundered Temple is set on fire&mdash;a point which, as has
been noticed above, is completely applicable only to the
Chaldean invasion. Similarly, the next clause, "they
have profaned the dwelling-place of Thy name to the
ground," does not apply in literality to the action of
Antiochus, who did indeed desecrate, but did not destroy,
the Temple. The expression is a pregnant one, and
calls for some such supplement as is given above,
which, however, dilutes its vigour while it elucidates
its meaning. In ver. 8 the word "let us crush them"
has been erroneously taken as a noun, and rendered
"their brood," a verb like "we will root out" being
supplied. So the LXX. and some of the old versions,
followed by Hitzig and Baethgen. But, as Delitzsch
well asks,&mdash;Why are only the children to be rooted
out? and why should the object of the action be expressed,
and not rather the action, of which the object
would be self-evident? The "meeting-places of God
in the land" cannot be old sanctuaries, nor the high
places, which were Israel's sin; for no psalmist could
have adduced the destruction of these as a reason for
God's intervention. They can only be the synagogues.
The expression is a strong argument for the later date
of the psalm. Equally strong is the lament in ver. 9
over the removal of the "signs"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, as in ver. 4, the
emblems of religion, or the sacrifices and festivals, suppressed
by Antiochus, which were the tokens of the
covenant between God and Israel. The silence of
prophecy cannot be alleged of the Chaldean period without
some straining of facts and of the words here; nor
is it true that then there was universal ignorance of the
duration of the calamity, for Jeremiah had foretold it.</p>

<p>Vv. 10 and 11 are the kernel of the psalm, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
rest of which is folded round them symmetrically.
Starting from this centre and working outwards, we
note that it is preceded by six verses dilating on the
profanations of the name of God, and followed by six
setting forth the glories of that name in the past. The
connection of these two portions of the psalm is obvious.
They are, as it were, the inner shell round the kernel.
The outer shell is the prayer in three verses which begins
the psalm, and that in six verses which closes it. Ver. 10
takes up the despairing "How long" from the end
of the preceding portion, and turns it into a question
to God. It is best to ask Him, when ignorance pains
us. But the interrogation does not so much beg for
enlightenment as to the duration of the calamity as for its
abbreviation. It breathes not precisely impatience, but
longing that a state of things so dishonouring to God
should end. That aspect, and not personal suffering, is
prominent in the verse. It is "Thy name" which is
insulted by the adversaries actions, and laid open to
their contempt, as the name of a Deity powerless to
protect His worshippers. Their action "reproaches,"
and His inaction lets them "despise," His name. The
psalmist cannot endure that this condition should drag
on indefinitely, as if "for ever," and his prayer-question
"How long?" is next exchanged for another similar
blending of petition and inquiry, "<i>Why</i> dost Thou
draw back Thy hand?" Both are immediately translated
into that petition which they both really mean.
"From the midst of Thy bosom consume," is a
pregnant phrase, like that in ver. 7 <i>b</i>, and has to be
completed as above, though, possibly, the verb stands
absolutely as equivalent to "make an end"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, of such
a state of things.</p>

<p>The psalmist's petition is next grounded on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
revelation of God's name in Israel's past, and in
creative acts of power. These at once encourage him
to expect that God will pluck His hand out from the
folds of His robe, where it lies inactive, and appeal
to God to be what He has been of old, and to rescue
the name which He has thus magnified from insult.
There is singular solemnity in the emphatic reiteration
of "Thou" in these verses. The Hebrew does
not usually express the pronominal nominative to a
verb, unless special attention is to be called to it; but
in these verses it does so uniformly, with one exception,
and the sevenfold repetition of the word brings forcibly
into view the Divine personality and former deeds
which pledge God to act now. Remembrance of past
wonders made present misery more bitter, but it also
fanned into a flame the spark of confidence that the
future would be like the past. One characteristic of
the Asaph psalms is wistful retrospect, which is sometimes
the basis of rebuke, and sometimes of hope, and
sometimes of deepened sorrow, but is here in part
appeal to God and in part consolation. The familiar
instances of His working drawn from the Exodus
history appear in the psalm. First comes the dividing
of the Red Sea, which is regarded chiefly as occasioning
the destruction of the Egyptians, who are symbolised by
the "sea-monsters" and by "leviathan" (the crocodile).
Their fate is an omen of what the psalmist hopes may
befall the oppressors of his own day. There is great
poetic force in the representation that the strong hand,
which by a stroke parted the waters, crushed by the
same blow the heads of the foul creatures who "floated
many a rood" on them. And what an end for the
pomp of Pharaoh and his host, to provide a meal for
jackals and the other beasts of the desert, who tear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
corpses strewing the barren shore! The meaning is
completely misapprehended when "the people inhabiting
the wilderness" is taken to be wild desert tribes. The
expression refers to animals, and its use as designating
them has parallels (as Prov. xxx. 25, 26).</p>

<p>In ver. 15 another pregnant expression occurs, which
is best filled out as above, the reference being to
cleaving the rock for the flow of water, with which is
contrasted in <i>b</i> the drying up of the Jordan. Thus
the whole of the Exodus period is covered. It is
noteworthy that the psalmist adduces only wonders
wrought on waters, being possibly guided in his
selection by the familiar poetic use of floods and seas
as emblems of hostile power and unbridled insolence.
From the wonders of history he passes to those of creation,
and chiefly of that might by which times alternate
and each constituent of the Kosmos has its appointed
limits. Day and night, summer and winter, recur by
God's continual operation. Is there to be no dawning
for Israel's night of weeping, and no summer making
glad the winter of its discontent? "Thou didst set all
the bounds of the earth,"&mdash;wilt Thou not bid back this
surging ocean which has transgressed its limits and
filled the breadth of Thy land? All the lights in the
sky, and chiefly the greatest of them, Thou didst
establish,&mdash;surely Thou wilt end this eclipse in which
Thy people grope.</p>

<p>Thus the psalmist lifts himself to the height of
confident though humble prayer, with which the psalm
closes, recurring to the opening tones. Its centre is, as
we have seen, a double remonstrance&mdash;"How long?"
and "Why?" The encircling circumference is earnest
supplication, of which the keynote is "Remember" (vv.
2 and 18).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>The gist of this closing prayer is the same appeal
to God to defend His own honour, which we have found
in the former verses. It is put in various forms here.
Twice (vv. 18 and 22) God is besought to remember
the reproach and contumely heaped on his name, and
apparently warranted by His inaction. The claim
of Israel for deliverance is based in ver. 19 upon its
being "<i>Thy</i> turtle dove," which therefore cannot be
abandoned without sullying Thy fame. The psalmist
spreads the "covenant" before God, as reminding Him of
His obligations under it. He asks that such deeds may
be done as will give occasion to the afflicted and needy
to "praise Thy name," which is being besmirched
by their calamities. Finally, in wonderfully bold words,
he calls on God to take up what is, after all, "His
own" quarrel, and, if the cry of the afflicted does not
move Him, to listen to the loud voices of those who
blaspheme Him all the day. Reverent earnestness
of supplication sometimes sounds like irreverence; but,
"when the heart's deeps boil in earnest," God understands
the meaning of what sounds strange, and recognises
the profound trust in His faithfulness and love
which underlies bold words.</p>

<p>The precise rendering of ver. 19 is very doubtful.
The word rendered above by "company" may mean
<i>life</i> or <i>a living creature</i>, or, collectively, a <i>company</i> of
such. It has been taken in all these meanings here,
and sometimes in one of them in the first clause, and
in another in the second, as most recently by Baethgen,
who renders "Abandon not to <i>the beast</i>" in <i>a</i>, and
"<i>The life of</i> thine afflicted" in <i>b</i>. But it must have
the same meaning in both clauses, and the form of the
word shows that it must be construed in both with
a following "of." If so, the rendering adopted above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
is best, though it involves taking the word rendered
"greed" (lit., soul) in a somewhat doubtful sense. This
rendering is adopted in the R.V. (margin), and is, on
the whole, the least difficult, and yields a probable sense.
Delitzsch recognises the necessity for giving the ambiguous
word the same meaning in both clauses, and
takes that meaning to be "creature," which suits well
enough in <i>a</i>, but gives a very harsh meaning to <i>b</i>.
"Forget not Thy poor animals for ever" is surely an
impossible rendering. Other attempts have been made
to turn the difficulty by textual alteration. Hupfeld
would transpose two words in <i>a</i>, and so gets "Give not
up to rage the life of Thy dove." Cheyne corrects the
difficult word into "to the sword," and Graetz follows
Dyserinck in preferring "to death," or Krochmal, who
reads "to destruction." If the existing text is retained,
probably the rendering adopted above is best.</p>

<p>This psalm deals with the general thought of
God's judgment in history, especially on heathen
nations. It has no clear marks of connection with any
particular instance of that judgment. The prevalent
opinion has been that it refers, like the next psalm,
to the destruction of Sennacherib's army. There are
in it slight resemblances to psalm xlvi., and to Isaiah's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
prophecies regarding that event, which support the
conjecture. Cheyne seems to waver, as on page 148
of "Orig. of Psalt." he speaks of "the two Maccabean
psalms, lxxiv. and lxxv.," and on page 166 concludes
that they "may be Maccabean, ... but we cannot claim
for this view the highest degree of probability, especially
as neither psalm refers to any warlike deeds of Israelites.
It is safer, I think, to ... assign them at the earliest
to one of the happier parts of the Persian age." It is
apparently still safer to refrain from assigning them
to any precise period.</p>

<p>The kernel of the psalm is a majestic Divine utterance,
proclaiming God's judgment as at hand. The limits
of that Divine word are doubtful, but it is best taken
as occupying two pairs of verses (2-5). It is preceded
by one verse of praise, and followed by three (6-8)
of warning spoken by the psalmist, and by two (9, 10,)
in which he again praises God the Judge, and stands
forth as an instrument of His judicial acts.</p>

<p>In ver. 1, which is as a prelude to the great Voice from
heaven, we hear the nation giving thanks beforehand
for the judgment which is about to fall. The second
part of the verse is doubtful. It may be taken thus:
"And Thy name is near; they (<i>i.e.</i>, men) declare Thy
wondrous works." So Delitzsch, who comments: The
Church "welcomes the future acts of God with fervent
thanks, and all they that belong to it declare beforehand
God's wondrous works." Several modern scholars,
among whom are Grätz, Baethgen, and Cheyne, adopt
a textual alteration which gives the reading, "They who
call upon Thy name declare," etc. But the rendering
of the A.V., which is also that of Hupfeld and Perowne,
gives a good meaning. All God's deeds in history
proclaim that He is ever at hand to help. His name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
is His character as revealed by His self-manifestation;
and this is the glad thanks-evoking lesson, taught by
all the past and by the judicial act of which the psalm
is the precursor&mdash;that He is near to deliver His people.
As Deut. iv. 7 has it, "What nation is there that hath
God so near unto them?"</p>

<p>The Divine voice breaks in with majestic abruptness,
as in Psalm xlvi. 10. It proclaims impending judgment,
which will restore society, dissolving in dread or
moral corruption, and will abase insolent wickedness,
which is therefore exhorted to submission. In ver. 2
two great principles are declared&mdash;one in regard to the
time and the other in regard to the animating spirit
of God's judgment. Literally, the first words of the
verse run, "When I lay hold of the appointed time."
The thought is that He has His own appointed time
at which His power will flash forth into act, and that
till that moment arrives evil is permitted to run its
course, and insolent men to play their "fantastic tricks"
before an apparently indifferent or unobserving God.
His servants are tempted to think that He delays too
long; His enemies, that He will never break His
silence. But the slow hand traverses the dial in time,
and at last the hour strikes and the crash comes
punctually at the moment. The purposes of delay are
presented in Scripture as twofold: on the one hand,
"that the long-suffering of God may lead to repentance";
and on the other, that evil may work itself out and
show its true character. To learn the lesson that,
"when the set time is come," judgment will fall, would
save the oppressed from impatience and despondency
and the oppressor from dreams of impunity. It is
a law fruitful for the interpretation of the world's
history. The other fundamental truth in this verse is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
that the principle of God's judgment is equity, rigid
adherence to justice, so that every act of man's shall
receive accurately "its just recompense of reward."
The "I" of ver. 2 <i>b</i> is emphatic. It brings to view
the lofty personality of the Judge, and asserts the
operation of a Divine hand in human affairs, while it
also lays the basis for the assurance that, the judgment
being His, and He being what He is, it must be
"according to truth."</p>

<p>Such a "set time" has arrived, as ver. 3 proceeds to
declare. Oppression and corruption have gone so far
that "the earth and its inhabitants" are as if "dissolved."
All things are rushing to ruin. The psalmist does not
distinguish between the physical and the moral here.
His figure is employed in reference to both orders,
which he regards as indissolubly connected. Possibly
he is echoing Psalm xlvi. 6, "The earth melted," though
there the "melting" is an expression for dread occasioned
by God's voice, and here rather refers to the
results of "the proud man's wrong." At such a supreme
moment, when the solid framework of society and of
the world itself seems to be on the point of dissolution,
the mighty Divine Personality intervenes; that strong
hand is thrust forth to grasp the tottering pillars and
stay their fall; or, in plain words, God Himself then
intervenes to re-establish the moral order of society,
and thus to save the sufferers. (Comp. Hannah's song
in 1 Sam. ii. 8.) That intervention has necessarily two
aspects, being on the one hand restorative, and on the
other punitive. Therefore in vv. 4 and 5 follow Divine
warnings to the "fools" and "wicked," whose insolent
boasting and tyranny have provoked it. The word
rendered "fools" seems to include the idea of boastfulness
as well as folly in the Biblical sense of that word,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
which points to moral rather than to merely intellectual
aberration. "Lifting up the horn" is a symbol of
arrogance. According to the accents, the word rendered
"stiff" is not to be taken as attached to "neck", but as
the object of the verb "speak," the resulting translation
being, "Speak not arrogance with a [stretched out]
neck"; and thus Delitzsch would render. But it is
more natural to take the word in its usual construction
as an epithet of "neck", expressive of superciliously
holding a high head. Cheyne follows Baethgen in altering
the text so as to read "rock" for "neck"&mdash;a slight
change which is supported by the LXX. rendering
("Speak not unrighteousness against God")&mdash;and
renders "nor speak arrogantly of the rock." Like the
other advocates of a Maccabean date, he finds here
a reference to the mad blasphemies of Antiochus
Epiphanes; but the words would suit Rabshakeh's
railings quite as well.</p>

<p>The exact point where the Divine oracle passes into
the psalmist's own words is doubtful. Ver. 7 is evidently
his; and that verse is so closely connected
with ver. 6 that it is best to make the break at the
end of ver. 5, and to suppose that what follows is the
singer's application of the truths which he has heard.
Two renderings of ver. 6 <i>b</i> are possible, which, though
very different in English, turn on the minute difference
in the Hebrew of one vowel sign. The same letters
spell the Hebrew word meaning <i>mountains</i> and that
meaning <i>lifting up</i>. With one punctuation of the preceding
word "wilderness," we must translate "from the
wilderness of mountains"; with another, the two words
are less closely connected, and we must render, "from
the wilderness is lifting up." If the former rendering
is adopted, the verse is incomplete, and some phrase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
like "help comes" must be supplied, as Delitzsch
suggests. But "lifting up" occurs so often in this
psalm, that it is more natural to take the word in that
meaning here, especially as the next verse ends with it,
in a different tense, and thus makes a sort of rhyme
with this verse. "The wilderness of mountains," too,
is a singular designation, either for the Sinaitic peninsula
or for Egypt, or for the wilderness of Judah,
which have all been suggested as intended here. "The
wilderness" stands for the south, and thus three
cardinal points are named. Why is the north omitted?
If "lifting up" means deliverance, the omission may be
due to the fact that Assyria (from which the danger
came, if we adopt the usual view of the occasion of the
psalm) lay to the north. But the meaning in the rest
of the psalm is not <i>deliverance</i>, and the psalmist is
addressing the "foolish boasters" here and that consideration
takes away the force of such an explanation
of the omission. Probably no significance attaches to
it. The general idea is simply that "lifting up" does
not come from any quarter of earth, but, as the next
verse goes on to say, solely from God. How absurd,
then, is the self-sufficient loftiness of godless men!
How vain to look along the low levels of earth, when
all true elevation and dignity come from God! The
very purpose of His judicial energy is to abase the lofty
and raise the low. His hand lifts up, and there is no
secure or lasting elevation but that which He effects.
His hand casts down, and that which attracts His
lightnings is "the haughtiness of man." The outburst
of His judgment works like a volcanic eruption, which
flings up elevations in valleys and shatters lofty
peaks. The features of the country are changed after
it, and the world looks new. The metaphor of ver. 8,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
in which judgment is represented as a cup of foaming
wine, which God puts to the lips of the nations, receives
great expansion in the prophets, especially in Jeremiah,
and recurs in the Apocalypse. There is a grim contrast
between the images of festivity and hospitality called
up by the picture of a host presenting the wine cup to
his guests, and the stern compulsion which makes the
"wicked" gulp down the nauseous draught held by
God to their reluctant lips. The utmost extremity of
punitive inflictions, unflinchingly inflicted, is suggested
by the terrible imagery. And the judgment is to be
world-wide; for "all the wicked of the earth" are to
drink, and that to the dregs.</p>

<p>And how does the prospect affect the psalmist? It
moves him, first, to solemn praise&mdash;not only because
God has proved Himself by these terrible things in
righteousness to be the God of His people, but also
because He has thereby manifested His own character
as righteous and hating evil. It is no selfish nor cruel
joy which stirs in devout hearts, when God comes forth
in history and smites oppressing insolence. It is but
a spurious benevolence which affects to recoil from the
conception of a God who judges and, when needful,
smites. This psalmist not only praised, but in his
degree vowed to imitate.</p>

<p>The last verse is best understood as his declaration
of his own purpose, though some commentators have
proposed to transfer it to the earlier part of the psalm,
regarding it as part of the Divine oracle. But it is in
its right place where it stands. God's servants are
His instruments in carrying out His judgments; and
there is a very real sense in which all of them should
seek to fight against dominant evil and to cripple the
power of tyrannous godlessness.</p>

<p>In contents and tone this psalm is connected with
Psalms xlvi. and xlviii. No known event corresponds
so closely with its allusions as the destruction
of Sennacherib's army, to which the LXX. in its superscription
refers it. The singer is absorbed in the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
tremendous judgment which had delivered the dwelling-place
of Jehovah. His song has but one theme&mdash;God's
forth-flashing of judgment on Zion's foes. One note of
thankfulness sounds at the close, but till then all is
awe. The psalm is divided into four strophes, of three
verses each. The former two describe the act; the
latter two deal with its results, in an awed world and
thankful praise.</p>

<p>The emphatic words in the first strophe are those
which designate the scene of the Divine act. The glow
of humble pride, of wonder and thankfulness, is perceptible
in the fourfold reiteration&mdash;"in Judah, in Israel,
in Salem, in Zion"; all which names are gathered up
in the eloquent "There" of ver. 3. The true point
of view from which to regard God's acts is that they
are His Self-revelation. The reason why Israel is the
object of the acts which manifest His name is that there
He has chosen to dwell. And, since He dwells there,
the special act of judgment which the psalm celebrates
was there performed. "The lightnings of the bow"
picturesquely designate arrows, from their swift flight
and deadly impact. (Compare Psalm xlvi. 9.)</p>

<p>The second strophe (vv. 4-6) comes closer to the
fact celebrated, and describes, with magnificent sweep,
brevity, and vividness, the death sleep of the enemy.
But, before it shows the silent corpses, it lifts one
exclamation of reverence to the God who has thus
manifested His power. The word rendered "Effulgent"
is doubtful, and by a slight transposition of letters
becomes, as in ver. 7 which begins the next strophe,
"dread." In ver. 4 <i>b</i> the rendering "more excellent
than," etc., yields a comparison which can scarcely be
called worthy. It is little to say of God that He is
more glorious than the enemies' "mountains of prey,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
though Delitzsch tries to recommend this rendering,
by supposing that God is represented as towering above
"the Lebanon of the hostile army of peoples." The
Hebrew idiom expresses comparison by the preposition
<i>from</i> appended to the adjective in its simple form, and
it is best here to take the construction as indicating
point of departure rather than comparison. God comes
forth as "glorious," from the lofty heights where He
sits supreme. But "mountains of prey" is a singular
phrase, which can only be explained by the supposition
that God is conceived of as a Conqueror, who has laid
up His spoils in His inaccessible store-house on high.
But the LXX. translates "<i>everlasting</i> mountains," which
fits the context well, and implies a text, which might
easily be misinterpreted as meaning "prey," which
misinterpretation may afterwards have crept into the
body of the text. If this alteration is not adopted, the
meaning will be as just stated.</p>

<p>Ver. 5 gives some support to the existing text, by
its representation of the stout-hearted foe as "spoiled."
They are robbed of their might, their weapons, and
their life. How graphically the psalmist sets before
the eyes of his readers the process of destruction from
its beginning! He shows us the warriors falling asleep
in the drowsiness of death. How feeble their "might"
now! One vain struggle, as in the throes of death,
and the hands which shot the "lightnings of the bow"
against Zion are stiff for evermore. One word from
the sovereign lips of the God of Jacob, and all the noise
of the camp is hushed, and we look out upon a field of
the dead, lying in awful stillness, dreamlessly sleeping
their long slumber.</p>

<p>The third strophe passes from description of the destruction
of the enemy to paint its widespread results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
in the manifestation to a hushed world of God's judgment.
In it anger and love are wondrously blended;
and while no creature can bear the terrible blaze of
His face, nor endure the weight of His onset "in the
time of His anger," the most awful manifestations
thereof have a side of tenderness and an inner purpose
of blessing. The core of judgment is mercy. It is
worthy of God to smite the oppressor and to save
the "afflicted," who not only suffer, but trust. When
He makes His judgments reverberate from on high,
earth should keep an awed stillness, as nature does
when thunder peals. When some gigantic and hoary
iniquity crashes to its fall, there is a moment of awed
silence after the hideous tumult.</p>

<p>The last strophe is mainly a summons to praise God
for His manifestation of delivering judgment. Ver. 10 is
obscure. The first clause is intelligible enough. Since
God magnifies His name by His treatment of opposing
men, who set themselves against Him, their very
foaming fury subserves His praise. That is a familiar
thought with all the Scripture writers who meditate on
God's dealings. But the second clause is hard. Whose
"wraths" are spoken of in it? God's or man's? The
change from the singular ("wrath of man") to plural
("wraths") in <i>b</i> makes it all but certain that God's
fulness of "wrath" is meant here. It is set over
against the finite and puny "wrath" of men, as an
ocean might be contrasted with a shallow pond. If so,
God's girding Himself with the residue of His own
wrath will mean that, after every such forth-putting of
it as the psalm has been hymning, there still remains
an unexhausted store ready to flame out if need
arise. It is a stern and terrible thought of God, but
it is solemnly true. His loving-kindness out-measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
man's, and so does His judicial judgment. All Divine
attributes partake of Infinitude, and the stores of His
punitive anger are not less deep than those of His
gentle goodness.</p>

<p>Therefore men are summoned to vow and pay their
vows; and while Israel is called to worship, the nations
around, who have seen that field of the dead, are called
to do homage and bring tribute to Him who, as it so
solemnly shows, can cut off the breath of the highest,
or can cut down their pride, as a grape-gatherer does
the ripe cluster (for such is the allusion in the word
"cuts down"). The last clause of the psalm, which
stands somewhat disconnected from the preceding,
gathers up the lessons of the tremendous event which
inspired it, when it sets Him forth as to be feared by
the kings of the earth.</p>

<p>The occasion of the profound sadness of the first
part of this psalm may be inferred from the
thoughts which brighten it into hope in the second.
These were the memories of past national deliverance.
It is natural to suppose that present national disasters
were the causes of the sorrow which enveloped the
psalmist's spirit and suggested questions of despair,
only saved from being blasphemous because they were
so wistful. But it by no means follows that the singer
is simply the personified nation. The piercing tone of
individual grief is too clear, especially in the introductory
verses, to allow of that hypothesis. Rather,
the psalmist has taken into his heart the troubles of
his people. Public calamity has become personal pain.
What dark epoch has left its marks in this psalm
remains uncertain. If Delitzsch's contention that
Habakkuk iii. is in part drawn from it were indubitably
established, the attribution of the psalm to the times of
Josiah would be plausible; but there is, at least, room
for doubt whether there has been borrowing, and if so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
which is original and which echo. The calamities of
the Exile in their severity and duration would give
reasonable ground for the psalmist's doubts whether
God had not cast off His people for ever. No brief
or partial eclipse of His favour would supply adequate
occasion for these.</p>

<p>The psalm falls into two parts, in the former of
which (vv. 1-9) deepest gloom wraps the singer's spirit,
while in the latter (vv. 10-20) the clouds break. Each
of these parts falls into three strophes, usually of three
verses; but in the concluding strophe, consisting of five,
Selah stands at the end of the first and third, and is
not present at the end of the second, because it is more
closely connected with the third than with the first.
In like manner the first strophe of the second part
(vv. 10-12) has no Selah, but the second has (vv. 13-15);
the closing strophe (vv. 16-20) being thus parted off.</p>

<p>The psalmist's agitation colours his language, which
fluctuates in the first six verses between expressions of
resolve or desire (vv. 1, 3, 6) and simple statement of
fact (vv. 2, 4, 5). He has prayed long and earnestly,
and nothing has been laid in answer on his outstretched
palm. Therefore his cry has died down into a sigh.
He fain would lift his voice to God, but dark thoughts
make him dumb for supplication, and eloquent only in
self-pitying monologue. A man must have waded
through like depths to understand this pathetic bewilderment
of spirit. They who glide smoothly over a sunlit
surface of sea little know the terrors of sinking, with
choked lungs, into the abyss. A little experience will
go further than much learning in penetrating the
meaning of these moanings of lamed faith. They begin
with an elliptical phrase, which, in its fragmentary
character, reveals the psalmist's discomposure. "My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
voice to God" evidently needs some such completion as
is supplied above; and the form of the following verb
("cry") suggests that the supplied one should express
wish or effort. The repetition of the phrase in 1 <i>b</i>
strengthens the impression of agitation. The last
words of that clause may be a petition, "give ear," but
are probably better taken as above. The psalmist
would fain cry to God, that he may be heard. He has
cried, as he goes on to tell in calmer mood in ver. 2,
and has apparently not been heard. He describes his
unintermitted supplications by a strong metaphor. The
word rendered "stretched out" is literally <i>poured out</i>
as water, and is applied to weeping eyes (Lam. iii. 49).
The Targum substitutes eye for hand here, but that is
commentary, not translation. The clause which we
render "without ceasing" is literally "and grew not
stiff." That word, too, is used of tears, and derivatives
from it are found in the passage just referred to in Lamentations
("intermission"), and in Lam. ii. 18 ("rest").
It carries on the metaphor of a stream, the flow of
which is unchecked. The application of this metaphor
to the hand is harsh, but the meaning is plain&mdash;that all
night long the psalmist extended his hand in the attitude
of prayer, as if open to receive God's gift. His voice
"rose like a fountain night and day"; but brought no
comfort to his soul; and he bewails himself, in the
words which tell of Jacob's despair when he heard that
Joseph was dead. <i>So</i> rooted and inconsolable does he
think his sorrows. The thought of God has changed
its nature, as if the sun were to become a source of
darkness. When he looks up, he can only sigh; when
he looks within, his spirit is clothed or veiled&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
wrapped in melancholy.</p>

<p>In the next strophe of three verses (vv. 4-6) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
psalmist plunges yet deeper into gloom, and unfolds
more clearly its occasion. Sorrow, like a beast of prey,
devours at night; and every sad heart knows how eyelids,
however wearied, refuse to close upon as wearied
eyes, which gaze wide opened into the blackness and
see dreadful things there. This man felt as if God's
finger was pushing up his lids and forcing him to stare
out into the night. Buffeted, as if laid on an anvil and
battered with the shocks of doom, he cannot speak; he
can only moan, as he is doing. Prayer seems to be
impossible. But to say, "I cannot pray; would that I
could!" is surely prayer, which will reach its destination,
though the sender knows it not. The psalmist had
found no ease in remembering God. He finds as little
in remembering a brighter past. That he should have
turned to history in seeking for consolation implies
that his affliction was national in its sweep, however
intensely personal in its pressure. This retrospective
meditation on the great deeds of old is characteristic
of the Asaph psalms. It ministers in them to many
moods, as memory always does. In this psalm we
have it feeding two directly opposite emotions. It may
be the nurse of bitter Despair, or of bright-eyed Hope.
When the thought of God occasions but sighs, the
remembrance of His acts can only make the present
more doleful. The heavy spirit finds reasons for
heaviness in God's past and in its own. The psalmist
in his sleepless vigils remembers other wakeful times,
when his song filled the night with music and "awoke
the dawn." Ver. 6 is parallel with ver. 3. The three
key-words, <i>remember</i>, <i>muse</i>, <i>spirit</i>, recur. There, musing
ended in wrapping the spirit in deeper gloom. Here,
it stings that spirit to activity in questionings, which
the next strophe flings out in vehement number and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
startling plainness. It is better to be pricked to even
such interrogations by affliction than to be made torpid
by it. All depends on the temper in which they are
asked. If that is right, answers which will scatter
gloom are not far off.</p>

<p>The comparison of present national evils with former
happiness naturally suggests such questions. Obviously,
the casting off spoken of in ver. 7 is that of the nation,
and hence its mention confirms the view that the
psalmist is suffering under public calamities. All the
questions mean substantially one thing&mdash;has God
changed? They are not, as some questions are, the
strongest mode of asserting their negative; nor are
they, like others, a more than half assertion of their
affirmative; but they are what they purport to be&mdash;the
anxious interrogations of an afflicted man, who would
fain be sure that God is the same as ever, but is
staggered by the dismal contrast of Now and Then.
He faces with trembling the terrible possibilities, and,
however his language may seem to regard failure of
resources or fickleness of purpose or limitations in
long-suffering as conceivable in God, his doubts are
better put into plain speech than lying diffused and
darkening, like poisonous mists, in his heart. A
thought, be it good or bad, can be dealt with when it
is made articulate. Formulating vague conceptions is
like cutting a channel in a bog for the water to run.
One gets it together in manageable shape, and the soil
is drained. So the end of the despondent half of the
psalm is marked by the bringing to distinct speech of
the suspicions which floated in the singer's mind and
made him miserable. The Selah bids us dwell on the
questions, so as to realise their gravity and prepare
ourselves for their answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>The second part begins in ver. 10 with an obscure
and much-commented-on verse, of which two explanations
are possible, depending mainly on the meanings
of the two words "sickness" and "years." The former
word may mean "my wounding" or "my sickness."
The latter is by many commentators taken to be an
infinitive verb, with the signification <i>to be changed</i>, and
by others to be a plural noun meaning "<i>years</i>,"
as in ver. 6. Neglecting some minor differences, we
may say that those who understand the word to mean
<i>being changed</i> explain the whole thus: "This is my
wound (misery, sorrow), that the right hand of the
Most High has changed." So the old versions, and
Hupfeld, Perowne, and Baethgen. But the use of the
word in ver. 6 for "years" creates a strong presumption
that its sense is the same here. As to the other
word, its force is best seen by reference to a closely
parallel passage in Jer. x. 19&mdash;"I said, Truly this is
my grief (margin, <i>sickness</i>), and I must bear it"; where
the word for <i>grief</i>, though not the same as in the psalm,
is cognate. The most probable meaning, then, for the
expression here is, "This my affliction is sent from
God, and I must bear it with resignation." Then
follows an elevating thought expressed in its simplest
form like an exclamation, "<i>the years</i>," etc.&mdash;<i>i.e.,</i>, "I will
remember (comp. ver. 6) the time when the right hand
of Jehovah had the pre-eminence" (Cheyne, <i>in loc.</i>).
Delitzsch leaves the ellipsis unfilled, and takes the
whole to mean that the psalmist says to himself that
the affliction allotted will only last for the time which the
mighty hand of God has determined. The rendering
adopted above avoids the awkwardness of using the
same word in two different senses in the same context,
yields an appropriate meaning, especially in view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
the continual references to remembering, and begins
the new strophe with a new note of hopefulness,
whereas the other renderings prolong the minor key
of the first part into the second. It is therefore to be
preferred. The revolution in feeling is abrupt. All
is sunny and bright in the last half. What makes the
change? The recognition of two great truths: first,
that the calamity is laid on Israel, and on the psalmist
as a member of the nation, by God, and has not come
because of that impossible change in Him which the
bitter questions had suggested; and, second, the unchangeable
eternity of God's delivering power. That
second truth comes to him as with a flash, and the
broken words of ver. 10 <i>b</i> hail the sudden rising of
the new star.</p>

<p>The remainder of the psalm holds fast by that
thought of the great deeds of God in the past. It is
a signal example of how the same facts remembered
may depress or gladden, according to the point of view
from which they are regarded. We can elect whether
memory shall nourish despondency or gladness. Yet
the alternative is not altogether a matter of choice; for
the only people to whom "remembering happier things"
need not be "a sorrow's crown of sorrow" are those
who see God in the past, and so are sure that every joy
that was and is not shall yet again be, in more thrilling
and lasting form. If He shines out on us from the
east that we have left behind, His brightness will paint
the western sky towards which we travel. Beneath
confidence in the perpetuity of past blessings lies confidence
in the eternity of God. The "years of the
right hand of the Most High" answer all questions as
to His change of purpose or of disposition, and supply
the only firm foundation for calm assurance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
future. Memory supplies the colours with which Hope
paints her truest pictures. "That which hath been is
that which shall be" may be the utterance of the <i>blasé</i>
man of the world, or of the devout man who trusts in
the living God, and therefore knows that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There shall never be one lost good!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">What was shall live as before."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The strophe in vv. 13-15 fixes on the one great
redeeming act of the Exodus as the pledge of future
deeds of a like kind, as need requires. The language
is deeply tinged with reminiscences of Exod. xv. "In
holiness" (not "in the sanctuary"), the question "Who
is so great a God?" the epithet "Who doest wonders,"
all come from Exod. xv. 11. "[Thine] arm" in the
psalm recalls "By the greatness of Thine arm" in
Exodus (ver. 16), and the psalmist's "redeemed Thy
people" reproduces "the people which Thou hast
redeemed" (Exod. xv. 13). The separate mention of
"sons of Joseph" can scarcely be accounted for, if the
psalm is prior to the division of the kingdoms. But
the purpose of the designation is doubtful. It may
express the psalmist's protest against the division as
a breach of ancient national unity or his longings for
reunion.</p>

<p>The final strophe differs from the others in structure.
It contains five verses instead of three, and the verses
are (with the exception of the last) composed of three
clauses each instead of two. Some commentators have
supposed that vv. 16-19 are an addition to the original
psalm, and think that they do not cohere well with
the preceding. This view denies that there is any
allusion in the closing verses to the passage of the Red
Sea, and takes the whole as simply a description of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
theophany, like that in Psalm xviii. But surely the
writhing of the waters as if in pangs at the sight of God
is such an allusion. Ver. 19, too, is best understood
as referring to the path through the sea, whose waters
returned and covered God's footprints from human
eyes. Unless there is such a reference in vv. 16-19,
the connection with the preceding and with ver. 20 is
no doubt loose. But that is not so much a reason
for denying the right of these verses to a place in the
psalm as for recognising the reference. Why should
a mere description of a theophany, which had nothing
to do with the psalmist's theme, have been tacked on
to it? No doubt, the thunders, lightnings, and storm
so grandly described here are unmentioned in Exodus;
and, quite possibly, may be simply poetic heightening
of the scene, intended to suggest how majestic was the
intervention which freed Israel. Some commentators,
indeed, have claimed the picture as giving additional
facts concerning the passage of the Red Sea. Dean
Stanley, for example, has worked these points into his
vivid description; but that carries literalism too far.</p>

<p>The picture in the psalm is most striking. The
continuous short clauses crash and flash like the thunders
and lightnings. That energetic metaphor of the
waters writhing as if panic-struck is more violent than
Western taste approves, but its emotional vigour as a
rendering of the fact is unmistakable. "Thine arrows
went to and fro" is a very imperfect transcript of the
Hebrew, which suggests the swift zigzag of the fierce
flashes. In ver. 18 the last word offers some difficulty.
It literally means <i>a wheel</i>, and is apparently best rendered
as above, the thunder being poetically conceived of as
the sound of the rolling wheels of God's chariot. There
are several coincidences between vv. 16-19 of the psalm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
and Hab. iii. 10-15: namely, the expression "writhed in
pain," applied in Habakkuk to the mountains; the word
rendered "overflowing" (A.V.) or "tempest" (R.V.)
in Hab. v. 10, cognate with the verb in ver. 17 of the
psalm, and there rendered "poured out"; the designation
of lightnings as God's arrows. Delitzsch strongly maintains
the priority of the psalm; Hupfeld as strongly
that of the prophet.</p>

<p>The last verse returns to the two-claused structure
of the earlier part. It comes in lovely contrast with
the majestic and terrible picture preceding, like the
wonderful setting forth of the purpose of the other
theophany in Psalm xviii., which was for no higher end
than to draw one poor man from the mighty waters.
All this pomp of Divine appearance, with lightnings,
thunders, a heaving earth, a shrinking sea, had for its
end the leading the people of God to their land, as a
shepherd does his flock. The image is again an echo
of Exod. xv. 13. The thing intended is not merely
the passage of the Red Sea, but the whole process of
guidance begun there amid the darkness. Such a close
is too abrupt to please some commentators. But what
more was needful or possible to be said, in a retrospect
of God's past acts, for the solace of a dark present?
It was more than enough to scatter fears and flash
radiance into the gloom which had wrapped the psalmist.
He need search no further. He has found what he
sought; and so he hushes his song, and gazes in silence
on the all-sufficient answer which memory has brought
to all his questions and doubts. Nothing could more
completely express the living, ever-present worth of the
ancient deeds of God than the "abruptness" with which
this psalm ceases rather than ends.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And returned and sought God earnestly.</span><br />
35  And they remembered that God was their rock,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And God Most High their redeemer.</span><br />
36  And they flattered Him with their mouth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And with their tongue they lied to Him,</span><br />
37  And their heart was not steadfast with Him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And they were not faithful to His covenant.</span><br />
<br />
38  But He is compassionate, covers iniquity, and destroys not;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Yea, many a time He takes back His anger,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And rouses not all His wrath.</span><br />
39  So He remembered that they were [but] flesh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A wind that goes and comes not again.</span><br />
<br />
40  How often did they provoke Him in the wilderness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Did they grieve Him in the desert!</span><br />
41  Yea, again and again they tempted God,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the Holy One of Israel they vexed.</span><br />
42  They remembered not His hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The day when He set them free from the adversary,</span><br />
43  When He set forth His signs in Egypt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And His wonders in the field of Zoan.</span><br />
44  And He turned to blood their Nile streams,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And their streams they could not drink.</span><br />
<br />
45  He sent amongst them flies that devoured them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And frogs that destroyed them.</span><br />
46  And He gave their increase to the caterpillar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And their toil to the locust.</span><br />
47  He killed their vines with hail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And their sycamores with frost. [?]</span><br />
48  And He gave their cattle up to the hail,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And their flocks to the lightnings.</span><br />
<br />
49  He sent against them the heat of His anger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wrath and indignation and trouble,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A mission of angels of evil.</span><br />
50  He levelled a path for His anger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He spared not their souls from death,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But delivered over their life to the pestilence.</span><br />
51  And He smote all the first-born of Egypt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The firstlings of [their] strength in the tents of Ham.</span><br />
<br />
52  And He made His people go forth like sheep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And guided them like a flock in the desert.</span><br />
53  And He led them safely, that they did not fear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the sea covered their enemies.</span><br />
54  And He brought them to His holy border,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">This mountain, which His right hand had won.</span><br />
55  And He drove out the nations before them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And allotted them by line as an inheritance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span><br />
<br />
56  But they tempted and provoked God Most High,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And His testimonies they did not keep.</span><br />
57  And they turned back and were faithless like their fathers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They were turned aside like a deceitful bow;</span><br />
58  And they provoked Him to anger with their high places,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And with their graven images they moved Him to jealousy.</span><br />
59  God heard and was wroth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And loathed Israel exceedingly.</span><br />
<br />
60  So that He rejected the habitation of Shiloh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The tent [which] He had pitched among men.</span><br />
61  And He gave His strength to captivity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And His beauty into the hand of the adversary.</span><br />
62  And He delivered His people to the sword,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And against His inheritance He was wroth.</span><br />
63  Their young men the fire devoured,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And their maidens were not praised in the marriage-song.</span><br />
64  Their priests fell by the sword,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And their widows made no lamentation.</span><br />
<br />
65  Then the Lord awoke as one that had slept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Like a warrior shouting because of wine.</span><br />
66  And He beat His adversaries back,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He put on them a perpetual reproach.</span><br />
67  And He loathed the tent of Joseph,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the tribe of Ephraim He did not choose.</span><br />
68  But He chose the tribe of Judah,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Mount Zion, which He loved.</span><br />
<br />
69  And He built His sanctuary like [heavenly] heights,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Like the earth which He has founded for ever.</span><br />
70  And He chose David His servant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And took him from the sheepfolds;</span><br />
71  From following the ewes that give suck, He brought him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To feed Jacob His people,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And Israel His inheritance.</span><br />
72  So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And with the skilfulness of his hands he guided them.</span><br />
</p>


<p>This psalm is closely related to Psalms cv.-cvii.</p>

<p>Like them, it treats the history of Israel, and
especially the Exodus and wilderness wanderings, for
purposes of edification, rebuke, and encouragement.
The past is held up as a mirror to the present generation.
It has been one long succession of miracles of
mercy met by equally continuous ingratitude, which
has ever been punished by national calamities. The
psalm departs singularly from chronological order. It
arranges its contents in two principal masses, each
introduced by the same formula (vv. 12, 43) referring
to "wonders in Egypt and the field of Zoan." But the
first mass has nothing to do with Egypt, but begins
with the passage of the Red Sea, and is wholly occupied
with the wilderness. The second group of wonders
begins in ver. 44 with the plagues of Egypt, touches
lightly on the wilderness history, and then passes to
the early history of Israel when settled in the land,
and finishes with the establishment of David on the
throne. It is difficult to account for this singular
<i>bouleversement</i> of the history. But the conjecture may
be hazarded that its reason lies in the better illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
of continual interlacing of mercy and unthankfulness
afforded by the events in the wilderness, than by the
plagues of Egypt. That interlacing is the main point
on which the psalmist wishes to lay stress, and therefore
he begins with the most striking example of it.
The use of the formula in ver. 12 looks as if his
original intention had been to follow the order of time.
Another peculiarity is the prominence given to Ephraim,
both in ver. 9 as a type of faithlessness, and in ver.
67 as rejected in favour of Judah. These references
naturally point to the date of the psalm as being subsequent
to the separation of the kingdoms; but whether
it is meant as rebuke to the northern kingdom, or as
warning to Judah from the fate of Ephraim, is not clear.
Nor are there materials for closer determination of date.
The tone of the closing reference to David implies that
his accession belongs to somewhat remote times.</p>

<p>There are no regular strophes, but a tendency to
run into paragraphs of four verses, with occasional
irregularities.</p>

<p>Vv. 1-4 declare the singer's didactic purpose. He
deeply feels the solidarity of the nation through all
generations&mdash;how fathers and children are knit by
mystic ties, and by possession of an eternal treasure,
the mighty deeds of God, of which they are bound to pass
on the record from age to age. The history of ancient
days is "a parable" and a "riddle" or "dark saying,"
as containing examples of great principles, and lessons
which need reflection to discern and draw out. From
that point of view, the psalmist will sum up the past.
He is not a chronicler, but a religious teacher. His
purpose is edification, rebuke, encouragement, the
deepening of godly fear and obedience. In a word,
he means to give the spirit of the nation's history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>Vv. 5-8 base this purpose on God's declared will
that the knowledge of His deeds for Israel might be
handed down from fathers to sons. The obligations
of parents for the religious training of their children,
the true bond of family unity, the ancient order of
things when oral tradition was the principal means
of preserving national history, the peculiarity of this
nation's annals, as celebrating no heroes and recording
only the deeds of God by men, the contrast between
the changing bearers of the story and the undying
deeds which they had to tell, are all expressed in these
verses, so pathetic in their gaze upon the linked series
of short-lived men, so stern in their final declaration
that Divine commandment and mercy had been in vain,
and that, instead of a tradition of goodness, there had
been a transmission of stubbornness and departure
from God, repeating itself with tragic uniformity.
The devout poet, who knows what God meant family
life to be and to do, sadly recognises the grim contrast
presented by its reality. But yet he will make one
more attempt to break the flow of evil from father to
son. Perhaps his contemporaries will listen and shake
themselves clear of this entail of disobedience.</p>

<p>The reference to Ephraim in vv. 9-11 is not to be
taken as alluding to any cowardly retreat from actual
battle. Ver. 9 seems to be a purely figurative way
of expressing what is put without a metaphor in the
two following verses. Ephraim's revolt from God's
covenant was like the conduct of soldiers, well armed
and refusing to charge the foe. The better their
weapons, the greater the cowardice and ignominy
of the recreants. So the faithlessness of Ephraim
was made darker in criminality by its knowledge of
God and experience of His mercy. These should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
knit the tribe to Him. A general truth of wide application
is implied&mdash;that the measure of capacity
is the measure of obligation. Guilt increases with
endowment, if the latter is misused. A poor soldier,
with no weapon but a sling or a stick, might sooner
be excused for flight than a fully armed archer. The
mention of Ephraim as prominent in faithlessness may
be an allusion to the separation of the kingdoms. That
allusion has been denied on the ground that it is the
wilderness history which is here before the psalmist's
mind. But the historical retrospect does not begin
till ver. 12, and this introduction may well deal with
an event later than those detailed in the following
verses. Whether the revolt of the Ten Tribes is here
in view or not, the psalmist sees that the wayward
and powerful tribe of Ephraim had been a centre of
religious disaffection, and there is no reason why his
view should not be believed, or should be supposed to
be due to mere prejudiced hostility.</p>

<p>The historical details begin with ver. 12, but, as has
been noticed above, the psalmist seems to change his
intention of first narrating the wonders in Egypt, and
passes on to dilate on the wilderness history. "The
field of Zoan" is the territory of the famous Egyptian
city of Tzan, and seems equivalent to the Land of
Goshen. The wonders enumerated are the familiar
ones of the passage of the Red Sea, the guidance by
the pillar of cloud and fire, and the miraculous supply
of water from the rock. In vv. 15, 16, the poet brings
together the two instances of such supply, which were
separated from each other by the forty years of wandering,
the first having occurred at Horeb in the first year,
and the second at Kadesh in the last year. The two
words "rocks," in ver. 15, and "cliff," in ver. 16, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
taken from the two narratives of these miracles, in
Exod. xvii. and Numb. xx.</p>

<p>The group of four verses (13-16) sets forth God's
mighty deeds; the next quartet of verses (17-20) tells
of Israel's requital. It is significant of the thoughts
which filled the singer's heart, that he begins the latter
group with declaring that, notwithstanding such tokens
of God's care, the people "went on to sin yet more,"
though he had specified no previous acts of sin. He
combines widely separated instances of their murmurings,
as he had combined distant instances of God's
miraculous supply of water. The complaints which
preceded the fall of the manna and the first supply of
quails (Exod. xvi.), and those which led to the second
giving of these (Numb. xi.) are thrown together, as
one in kind. The speech put into the mouths of the
murmurers in vv. 19, 20, is a poetic casting into bitter,
blasphemous words of the half-conscious thoughts of
the faithless, sensuous crowd. They are represented
as almost upbraiding God with His miracle, as quite
unmoved to trust by it, and as thinking that it has
exhausted His power. When they were half dead
with thirst, they thought much of the water, but now
they depreciate that past wonder as a comparatively
small thing. So, to the churlish heart, which cherishes
eager desires after some unattained earthly good, past
blessings diminish as they recede, and leave neither
thankfulness nor trust. There is a dash of intense
bitterness and ironical making light of their relation
to God in their question, "Can He provide flesh for
<i>His people</i>?" Much good that name has done us,
starving here! The root of all this blasphemous talk
was sensuous desire; and because the people yielded to
it, they "tempted God"&mdash;that is, they "unbelievingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
and defiantly demanded, instead of trustfully waiting
and praying" (Delitzsch). To ask food for their desires
was sin; to ask it for their need would have been faith.</p>

<p>In ver. 21 the allusion is to the "fire of the Lord,"
which, according to Numb. xi. 3, burnt in the camp,
just before the second giving of quails. It comes in
here out of chronological order, for the sending of
manna follows it; but the psalmist's didactic purpose
renders him indifferent to chronology. The manna is
called "corn of heaven" and "bread of the Mighty
Ones"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, angels, as the LXX. renders the word.
Both designations point to its heavenly origin, without
its being necessary to suppose that the poet thought of
angels as really eating it. The description of the fall
of the quails (vv. 26-29) is touched with imaginative
beauty. The word rendered above "made to go forth"
is originally applied to the breaking up an encampment,
and that rendered "guided" to a shepherd's
leading of his flock. Both words are found in the
Pentateuch, the former in reference to the wind that
brought the quails (Numb. xi. 31), the latter in reference
to that which brought the plague of locusts (Exod.
x. 13). So the winds are conceived of as God's
servants, issuing from their tents at His command, and
guided by Him as a shepherd leads his sheep. "He
let it fall in the midst of their camp" graphically
describes the dropping down of the wearied, storm-beaten
birds.</p>

<p>Vv. 30-33 paint the swift punishment of the people's
unbelief, in language almost identical with Numb. xi. 33.
The psalmist twice stigmatises their sin as "lust," and
uses the word which enters into the tragical name
given to the scene of the sin and the punishment&mdash;Kibroth-Hat
<i>taavah</i> (the graves of Lust). In vv. 32, 33,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
the faint-hearted despondency after the return of the
spies, and the punishment of it by the sentence of
death on all that generation, seem to be alluded to.</p>

<p>The next group of four verses describes the people's
superficial and transient repentance, "When He slew
them they sought Him"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, when the fiery serpents
were sent among them. But such seeking after God,
which is properly not seeking Him at all, but only
seeking to escape from evil, neither goes deep nor
lasts long. Thus the end of it was only lip reverence,
proved to be false by life, and soon ended. "Their
heart was not steadfast." The pressure being removed,
they returned to their habitual position, as all such
penitents do.</p>

<p>From the midst of this sad narrative of faithlessness,
springs up, like a fountain in a weary land, or a flower
among half-cooled lava blocks, the lovely description of
God's forbearance in vv. 38, 39. It must not be read
as if it merely carried on the narrative, and was in
continuation of the preceding clauses. The psalmist
does not say "He <i>was</i> full of compassion," though that
would be much, in the circumstances; but he is declaring
God's eternal character. His compassions are
unfailing. It is always His wont to cover sin and to
spare. Therefore He exercised these gracious forbearances
towards those obstinate transgressors. He was
true to His own compassion in remembering their
mortality and feebleness. What a melancholy sound,
as of wind blowing among forgotten graves, has that
summing up of human life as "a breath that goes and
comes not again"!</p>

<p>With ver. 40 the second portion of the psalm may
be regarded as beginning. The first group of historical
details dealt first with God's mercies, and passed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
to man's requital. The second starts with man's ingratitude,
which it paints in the darkest colours, as
provoking Him, grieving Him, tempting Him, and
vexing Him. The psalmist is not afraid to represent
God as affected with such emotions by reason of men's
indifference and unbelief. His language is not to be
waved aside as anthropomorphic and antiquated. No
doubt, we come nearer to the unattainable truth, when
we conceive of God as grieved by men's sins and
delighting in their trust, than when we think of Him
as an impassive Infinitude, serenely indifferent to
tortured or sinful hearts. For is not His name of
names Love?</p>

<p>The psalmist traces Israel's sin to forgetfulness of
God's mercy, and thus glides into a swift summing up
of the plagues of Egypt, regarded as conducing to
Israel's deliverance. They are not arranged chronologically,
though the list begins with the first. Then
follow three of those in which animals were the
destroyers: namely, the fourth, that of flies; the second,
that of frogs; and the eighth, that of locusts. Then
comes the seventh, that of hail; and, according to some
commentators, the fifth, that of the murrain, in ver. 49,
followed by the tenth in ver. 51. But the grand,
sombre imagery of ver. 49 is too majestic for such
application. It rather sums up the whole series of
plagues, likening them to an embassy (lit., a sending) of
angels of evil. They are a grim company to come forth
from His presence&mdash;Wrath, Indignation, and Trouble.
The same power which sent them out on their errand
prepared a way before them; and the crowning judgment,
which, in the psalmist's view was also the
crowning mercy, was the death of the first-born.</p>

<p>The next quartet of verses (vv. 52-55) passes lightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
over the wilderness history and the settlement in the
land, and hastens on to a renewed narration of repeated
rebellion, which occupies the next group (vv. 56-59).
These verses cover the period from the entrance on
Canaan to the fall of the sanctuary of Shiloh, during
which there was a continual tendency to relapse into
idolatry. That is the special sin here charged against
the Israel of the time of the Judges. The figure of a
"deceitful bow," in ver. 57, well describes the people
as failing to fulfil the purpose of their choice by God.
As such a weapon does not shoot true, and makes
the arrow fly wide, however well aimed and strongly
drawn, so Israel foiled all Divine attempts, and failed
to carry God's message to the world, or to fulfil His
will in themselves. Hence the next verses tell, with
intense energy and pathos, the sad story of Israel's
humiliation under the Philistines. The language is
extraordinarily strong in its description of God's loathing
and rejection of the nation and sanctuary, and
is instinct with sorrow, blended with stern recognition
of His righteousness in judgment. What a tragic
picture the psalmist draws! Shiloh, the dwelling-place
of God, empty for evermore; the "Glory"&mdash;that is,
the Ark&mdash;in the enemy's hands; everywhere stiffening
corpses; a pall of silence over the land; no brides and
no joyous bridal chaunts; the very priests massacred,
unlamented by their widows, who had wept so many
tears already that the fountain of them was dried up,
and even sorrowing love was dumb with horror and
despair!</p>

<p>The two last groups of verses paint God's great
mercy in delivering the nation from such misery. The
daring figure of His awaking as from sleep and dashing
upon Israel's foes, who are also His, with a shout like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
that of a hero stimulated by wine, is more accordant
with Eastern fervour than with our colder imagination;
but it wonderfully expresses the sudden transition from
a period, during which God seemed passive and careless
of His people's wretchedness, to one in which His
power flashed forth triumphant for their defence. The
prose fact is the long series of victories over the
Philistines and other oppressors, which culminated in
the restoration of the Ark, the selection of Zion as its
abode, which involved the rejection of Shiloh and consequently
of Ephraim (in whose territory Shiloh was),
and the accession of David. The Davidic kingdom is,
in the psalmist's view, the final form of Israel's national
existence; and the sanctuary, like the kingdom, is
perpetual as the lofty heavens or the firm earth. Nor
were his visions vain, for that kingdom subsists and
will subsist for ever, and the true sanctuary, the
dwelling-place of God among men, is still more closely
intertwined with the kingdom and its King than the
psalmist knew. The perpetual duration of both is,
in truth, the greatest of God's mercies, outshining all
earlier deliverances; and they who truly have become
the subjects of the Christ, the King of Israel and of
the world, and who dwell with God in His house, by
dwelling with Jesus, will not rebel against Him any
more, nor ever forget His wonders, but faithfully tell
them to the generations to come.</p>

<p>The same national agony which was the theme
of Psalm lxxiv. forced the sad strains of this psalm
from the singer's heart. There, the profanation of the
Temple, and here, the destruction of the city, are the
more prominent. There, the dishonour to God; here,
the distresses of His people, are set forth. Consequently,
confession of sin is more appropriate here, and prayers
for pardon blend with those for deliverance. But the
tone of both psalms is the same, and there are similarities
of expression which favour, though they do not
demand, the hypothesis that the author is the same.
Such similarities are the "how long" (lxxiv. 10 and
lxxix. 5); the desecration of the Temple (lxxiv. 3, 7, and
lxxix. 1); the giving over to wild beasts (lxxiv. 19,
and lxxix. 2); the reproach of God (lxxiv. 10, 18, 22,
and lxxix. 12). The comparison of Israel to a flock
is found in both psalms, but in others of the Asaph
group also.</p>

<p>The same remarks which were made as to the date
of the former psalm apply in this case. Two arguments
have, however, been urged against the Maccabean date.
The first is that drawn from the occurrence of vv. 6, 7,
in Jer. x. 25. It is contended that Jeremiah is in
the habit of borrowing from earlier writers, that the
verse immediately preceding that in question is quoted
from Psalm vi. 1, and that the connection of the
passage in the psalm is closer than in the prophet,
and, therefore, that the words are presumably <i>in situ</i>
here, as also that the verbal alterations are such as
to suggest that the prophet rather than the psalmist
is the adapter. But, on the other hand, Hupfeld
maintains that the connection in Jeremiah is the closer.
Not much weight can be attached to that point, for
neither prophet nor poet can be tied down to cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
concatenation of sentences. Delitzsch claims the verbal
alterations as indubitable proofs of the priority of the
prophet, and maintains that "the borrower betrays
himself" by changing the prophet's words into less
accurate and elegant ones, and by omissions which
impair "the soaring fulness of Jeremiah's expressions."
The critics who hold that the psalm refers to the
Chaldean invasion, and that Jeremiah has borrowed
from it, have to face a formidable difficulty. The psalm
must have been written after the catastrophe: the
prophecy preceded it. How then can the prophet be
quoting the psalm? The question has not been satisfactorily
answered, nor is it likely to be.</p>

<p>A second argument against the Maccabean date is
based upon the quotation of ver. 3 in 1 Macc. vii. 16,
which it introduces by the usual formula of quotation
from Scripture. It is urged that a composition so
recent as the psalm would be, if of Maccabean date,
would not be likely to be thus referred to. But this
argument confuses the date of occurrence recorded in
1 Maccabees with the date of the record; and there
is no improbability in the writer of the book quoting
as Scripture a psalm which had sprung from the midst
of the tragedy which he narrates.</p>

<p>The strophical division is not perfectly clear, but it
is probably best to recognise three strophes of four
verses each, with an appended verse of conclusion.
The first spreads before God His peoples miseries.
The second and third are prayer for deliverance and
confession of sin; but they differ, in that the former
strophe dwells mainly upon the wished-for destruction
of the enemy, and the latter upon the rescue of Israel,
while a subordinate diversity is that ancestral sins are
confessed in the one, and those of the present generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
in the other. Ver. 13 stands out of the strophe
scheme as a kind of epilogue.</p>

<p>The first strophe vividly describes the ghastly sights
that wrung the psalmist's heart, and will, as he trusts,
move God's to pity and help. The same thought as
was expressed in Psalm lxxiv. underlies the emphatic
repetition of "Thy" in this strophe&mdash;namely, the implication
of God's fair name in His people's disasters.
"<i>Thine</i> inheritance" is invaded, and "<i>Thy</i> holy Temple"
defiled by thee "heathen." The corpses of "<i>Thy</i> servants"
lie unburied, torn by vultures' beaks and jackals' claws.
The blood of "<i>Thy</i> favoured Ones" saturates the
ground. It was not easy to hold fast by the reality
of God's special relation to a nation thus apparently
deserted, but the psalmist's faith stood even such a
strain, and is not dashed by a trace of doubt. Such
times are the test and triumph of trust. If genuine,
it will show brightest against the blackest background.
The word in ver. 1 rendered "heathen" is usually
translated "nations," but here evidently connotes
idolatry (ver. 6). Their worship of strange gods,
rather than their alien nationality, makes their invasion
of God's inheritance a tragic anomaly. The psalmist
remembers the prophecy of Micah (iii. 12) that Jerusalem
should become heaps, and sadly repeats it as fulfilled
at last. As already noticed, ver. 3 is quoted in 1 Macc.
vii. 16, 17, and ver. 4 is found in Psalm xliv. 13, which
is by many commentators referred to the Maccabean
period.</p>

<p>The second strophe passes to direct petition, which,
as it were, gives voice to the stiffened corpses strewing
the streets, and the righteous blood crying from the
ground. The psalmist goes straight to the cause of
calamity&mdash;the anger of God&mdash;and, in the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
strophe, confesses the sins which had kindled it.
Beneath the play of politics and the madness of
Antiochus, he discerned God's hand at work. He
reiterates the fundamental lesson, which prophets were
never weary of teaching, that national disasters are
caused by the anger of God, which is excited by
national sins. That conviction is the first element
in his petitions. A second is the twin conviction that
the "heathen" are used by God as His instrument of
chastisement, but that, when they have done their work,
they are called to account for the human passion&mdash;cruelty,
lust of conquest, and the like&mdash;which impelled
them to it. Even as they poured out the blood of
God's people, they have God's wrath poured out on
them, because "they have eaten up Jacob."</p>

<p>The same double point of view is frequently taken
by the prophets: for example, in Isaiah's magnificent
prophecy against "the Assyrian" (x. 5 <i>seq.</i>), where
the conqueror is first addressed as "the rod of Mine
anger," and then his "punishment" is foretold, because,
while executing God's purpose, he had been unconscious
of his mission, and had been gratifying his ambition.
These two convictions go very deep into "the philosophy
of history." Though modified in their application
to modern states and politics, they are true in substance
still. The Goths who swept down on Rome, the
Arabs who crushed a corrupt Christianity, the French
who stormed across Europe, were God's scavengers,
gathered vulture-like round carrion, but they were
each responsible for their cruelty, and were punished
"for the fruit of their stout hearts."</p>

<p>The closing verse of the strophe (ver. 8) is intimately
connected with the next, which we take as beginning
the third strophe: but this connection does not set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
aside the strophical division, though it somewhat obscures
it. The distinction between the similar petitions
of vv. 8, 9, is sufficient to warrant our recognition
of that division, even whilst acknowledging that the
two parts coalesce more closely than usual. The
psalmist knows that the heathen have been hurled
against Israel because God is angry; and he knows
that God's anger is no arbitrarily kindled flame, but
one lit and fed by Israel's sins. He knows, too, that
there is a fatal entail by which the iniquities of the
fathers are visited on the children. Therefore, he asks
first that these ancestral sins may not be "remembered,"
nor their consequences discharged on the children's
heads. "The evil that men do lives after them," and
history affords abundant instances of the accumulated
consequences of ancestors' crimes lighting on descendants
that had abandoned the ancient evil, and were
possibly doing their best to redress it. Guilt is not
transmitted, but results of wrong are; and it is one
of the tragedies of history that "one soweth and another
reapeth" the bitter fruit. Upon one generation may,
and often does, come the blood of all the righteous
men that many generations have slain (Matt. xxiii. 35).</p>

<p>The last strophe (vv. 9-12) continues the strain
begun in ver. 8, but with significant deepening into
confession of the sins of the existing generation. The
psalmist knows that the present disaster is no case of
the fathers having eaten sour grapes and the children's
teeth being set on edge, but that he and his contemporaries
had repeated the fathers transgressions.
The ground of his plea for cleansing and deliverance
is the glory of God's name, which he emphatically puts
at the end of both clauses of ver. 9. He repeats the
same thought in another form in the question of ver. 10,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
"Why should the heathen say, Where is their God?"
If Israel, sinful though it is, and therefore meriting
chastisement, is destroyed, there will be a blot on
God's name, and the "heathen" will take it as proof,
not that Israel's God was just, but that He was
too feeble or too far off to hear prayers or to send
succours. It is bold faith which blends acknowledgment
of sins with such a conviction of the inextricable
intertwining of God's glory and the sinners' deliverance.
Lowly confession is wonderfully wedded to confidence
that seems almost too lofty. But the confidence is
in its inmost core as lowly as the confession, for it
disclaims all right to God's help, and clasps His name
as its only but sufficient plea.</p>

<p>The final strophe dwells more on the sufferings of
the survivors than the earlier parts of the psalm do,
and in this respect contrasts with Psalm lxxiv., which
is all but entirely silent as to these. Not only does
the spilt blood of dead confessors cry for vengeance,
since they died for their faith, as "Thy servants," but
the groans and sighs of the living who are captives,
and "sons of death"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, doomed to die, if unrescued
by God&mdash;appeal to Him. The expressions "the
groaning of the captive" and "the sons of death"
occur in Psalm cii. 20, from which, if this is a composition
of Maccabean date, they are here quoted. The
strophe ends with recurring to the central thought of
both this and the companion psalm&mdash;the reproach on
God from His servants' calamities&mdash;and prays that the
enemies' taunts may be paid back into their bosoms
sevenfold&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, in fullest measure.</p>

<p>The epilogue in ver. 13 has the image of a flock,
so frequent in the Asaph psalms, suggesting tender
thoughts of the shepherd's care and of his obligations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
Deliverance will evoke praise, and, instead of
the sad succession of sin and suffering from generation
to generation, the solidarity of the nation will
be more happily expressed by ringing songs, transmitted
from father to son, and gathering volume as they flow
from age to age.</p>

<p>This psalm is a monument of some time of great
national calamity; but its allusions do not enable
us to reach certainty as to what that calamity was.
Two striking features of it have been used as clues to
its occasion&mdash;namely, the designation of the nation as
"Joseph," and the mention of the three tribes in ver. 2.
Calvin, Delitzsch, Hengstenberg, and others are led
thereby to regard it as a prayer by an inhabitant of
Judah for the captive children of the northern kingdom;
while others, as Cheyne, consider that only the Persian
period explains the usage in question. The name
of "Joseph" is applied to the whole nation in other
Asaph psalms (lxxvii. 15; lxxxi. 5). It is tempting to
suppose, with Hupfeld, that this nomenclature indicates
that the ancient antagonism of the kingdoms has passed
away with the captivity of the Ten Tribes, and that the
psalmist, a singer in Judah, looks wistfully to the ideal
unity, yearns to see breaches healed, and the old associations
of happier days, when "Ephraim and Benjamin
and Manasseh" encamped side by side in the desert,
and marched one after the other, renewed in a restored
Israel. If this explanation of the mention of the tribes
is adopted, the psalm falls in some period after the
destruction of the northern kingdom, but prior to that
of Judah. The prayer in the refrain "turn us" might,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
indeed, mean "bring us back from exile," but may as
accurately be regarded as asking for restored prosperity&mdash;an
explanation which accords better with the rest
of the psalm. We take the whole, then, as a prayer
for the nation, conceived of in its original, long-broken
unity. It looks back to the Divine purpose as expressed
in ancient deeds of deliverance, and prays that it may
be fulfilled, notwithstanding apparent thwarting. Closer
definition of date is unattainable.</p>

<p>The triple refrain in vv. 3, 7, 19, divides the psalm
into three unequal parts. The last of these is disproportionately
long, and may be further broken up into three
parts, of which the first (vv. 8-11) describes the luxuriant
growth of Israel under the parable of a vine, the
second (vv. 12-14) brings to view the bitter contrast of
present ruin, and, with an imperfect echo of the refrain,
melts into the petitioning tone of the third (vv. 15-19),
which is all prayer.</p>

<p>In the first strophe "Shepherd of Israel" reminds us
of Jacob's blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh, in which
he invoked "the God who shepherded me all my life
long" to "bless the lads," and of the title in Gen.
xlix. 24, "the shepherd, the stone of Israel." The comparison
of the nation to a flock is characteristic of the
Asaph psalms, and here refers to the guidance of the
people at the Exodus. Delitzsch regards the notions
of the earthly and heavenly sanctuary as being blended
in the designation of God as sitting throned on the
cherubim, but it is better to take the reference as being
to His dwelling in the Temple. The word rendered
"shine forth" occurs in Psalm l. 2, where it expresses
His coming from "Zion," and so it does here. The
same metaphor underlies the subsequent petition in
ver. 3. In both God is thought of as light, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
manifestation of His delivering help is likened to the
blazing out of the sun from behind a cloud.</p>

<p>In reference to the mention of the tribes in ver. 2,
we need only add to what has been already said, that
the petitions of ver. 1, which look back to the wilderness
marches, when the Ark led the van, naturally suggested
the mention of the three tribes who were together
reckoned as "the camp of Ephraim," and who, in the
removal of the encampment, "set forth third"&mdash;that is,
immediately in the rear of the tabernacle. The order
of march explains not only the collocation here, but the
use of the word "Before." Joseph and Benjamin were
children of the same mother, and the schism which
parted their descendants is, to the psalmist's faith, as
transient as unnatural. Once again shall the old unity
be seen, when the brothers' sons shall again dwell and
fight side by side, and God shall again go forth before
them for victory.</p>

<p>The prayer of the refrain, "turn us," is not to be
taken as for restoration from exile, which is negatived
by the whole tone of the psalm, nor as for spiritual
quickening, but simply asks for the return of the
glories of ancient days. The petition that God would
let His face shine upon the nation alludes to the priestly
benediction (Numb. vi. 25), thus again carrying us
back to the wilderness. Such a flashing forth is all
that is needed to change blackest night into day.
To be "saved" means here to be rescued from the
assaults of hostile nations. The poet was sure that
Israel's sole defence was God, and that one gleam
of His face would shrivel up the strongest foes,
like unclean, slimy creatures which writhe and die in
sunshine. The same conviction is valid in a higher
sphere. Whatever elevation of meaning is given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
"saved," the condition of it is always this&mdash;the manifestation
of God's face. That brings light into all dark
hearts. To behold that light, and to walk in it, and to
be transformed by beholding, as they are who lovingly
and steadfastly gaze, is salvation.</p>

<p>A piteous tale of suffering is wailed forth in the
second strophe. The peculiar accumulation of the
Divine names in vv. 4, 19, is found also in Psalms
lix. 5 and lxxxiv. 8. It is grammatically anomalous,
as the word for God (Elohim) does not undergo the
modification which would show that the next word is
to be connected with it by "of." Hence, some have
regarded "Ts'bhaoth" (hosts) as being almost equivalent
to a proper name of God, which it afterwards
undoubtedly became; while others have explained the
construction by supposing the phrase to be elliptical,
requiring after "God" the supplement "God of." This
accumulation of Divine names is by some taken as a
sign of late date. Is it not a mark of the psalmist's
intensity rather than of his period? In accordance
with the Elohistic character of the Asaph psalms, the
common expression "Jehovah of Hosts" is expanded;
but the hypothesis that the expansion was the work of
a redactor is unnecessary. It may quite as well have
been that of the author.</p>

<p>The urgent question "How long?" is not petulant
impatience, but hope deferred, and, though sick at
heart, still cleaving to God and remonstrating for long-protracted
calamities. The bold imagery of ver. 4 <i>b</i>
cannot well be reproduced in translation. The rendering
"wilt Thou be angry?" is but a feeble reproduction
of the vigorous original, which runs "wilt Thou
smoke?" Other psalms (<i>e.g.</i>, lxxiv. 1) speak of God's
anger as smoking, but here the figure is applied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
God Himself. What a contrast it presents to the
petition in the refrain! That "light" of Israel has
become "as a flaming fire." A terrible possibility of
darkening and consuming wrath lies in the Divine
nature, and the very emblem of light suggests it. It
is questionable whether the following words should be
rendered "against the prayer of Thy people," or "while
Thy people are praying" (Delitzsch). The former
meaning is in accordance with the Hebrew, with other
Scripture passages, and with the tone of the psalm,
and is to be preferred, as more forcibly putting the
anomaly of an unanswering God. Ver. 5 presents the
national sorrows under familiar figures. The people's
food and drink were tears. The words of <i>a</i> may either
be rendered "bread of tears"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, eaten with, or rather
consisting of, tears; or, as above, "tears [as] bread."
The word rendered "in large measure" means "the
third part"&mdash;"of some larger measure." It is found
only in Isa. xl. 12. "The third part of an ephah is a
puny measure for the dust of the earth, [but] it is a
large measure for tears" (Delitzsch, <i>in loc.</i>). Ver. 6
adds one more touch to the picture&mdash;gleeful neighbours
cynically rejoicing to their hearts' content (lit., for
themselves) over Israel's calamities. Thus, in three
verses, the psalmist points to an angry God, a weeping
nation, and mocking foes, a trilogy of woe. On all he
bases an urgent repetition of the refrain, which is
made more imploring by the expanded name under
which God is invoked to help. Instead of the simple
"God," as in ver. 3, he now says "God of Hosts." As
sense of need increases, a true suppliant goes deeper
into God's revealed character.</p>

<p>From ver. 8 onwards the parable of the vine as
representing Israel fills the singer's mind. As has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
been already noticed, this part of the psalm may be
regarded as one long strophe, the parts of which follow
in orderly sequence, and are held closely together, as
shown by the recurrence of the refrain at the close
only. Three stages are discernible in it&mdash;a picture of
what has been, the contrast of what is now, and a
prayer for speedy help. The emblem of the vine,
which has received so great development in the prophets,
and has been hallowed for ever by our Lord's use of
it, seems to have been suggested to the psalmist by the
history of Joseph, to which he has already alluded.
For, in Jacob's blessing (Gen. xlix. 22 <i>seqq.</i>), Joseph
is likened to a fruitful bough. Other Old Testament
writers have drawn out the manifold felicities of the
emblem as applied to Israel. But these need not
concern us here, where the point is rather God's
husbandry and the vine's growth, both of which are in
startling contrast with a doleful present. The figure
is carried out with much beauty in detail. The
Exodus was the vine's transplanting; the destruction
of the Canaanites was the grubbing up of weeds to
clear the ground for it; the numerical increase of the
people was its making roots and spreading far. In
ver. 10 <i>b</i> the rendering may be either that adopted
above, or "And the cedars of God [were covered with]
its branches." The latter preserves the parallelism of
clauses and the unity of representation in vv. 10, 11,
which will then deal throughout with the spreading
growth of the vine. But the cedars would not have
been called "of God,"&mdash;which implies their great size,&mdash;unless
their dimensions had been in point, which
would not be the case if they were only thought of as
espaliers for the vine. And the image of its running
over the great trees of Lebanon is unnatural. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
rendering as above is to be preferred, even though it
somewhat mars the unity of the picture. The extent
of ground covered by the vine is described, in ver. 11,
as stretching from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates
(Deut. xi. 24; 1 Kings iv. 24). Such had been the
glories of the past; and they had all been the work of
God's hand.</p>

<p>In ver. 12 the miserable contrast of present desolation
is spread before God, with the bold and yet submissive
question "Why?" The vineyard wall is thrown
down, and the vine lies exposed to every vagrant
passenger, and to every destructive creature. Swine
from the woods burrow at its roots, and "whatever
moves on the plain" (Psalm l. 11, the only other
place where the expression occurs) feeds on it. The
parallelism forbids the supposition that any particular
enemy is meant by the wild boar. Hupfeld would
transpose ver. 16 so as to stand after ver. 13, which
he thinks improves the connection, and brings the last
part of the psalm into symmetrical form, in three equal
parts, containing four verses each. Cheyne would put
vv. 14, 15, before vv. 12, 13, and thereby secures
more coherence and sequence. But accuracy in these
matters is not to be looked for in such highly emotional
poetry, and perhaps a sympathetic ear may catch in the
broken words a truer ring than in the more orderly
arrangement of them by critics.</p>

<p>Ver. 14 sounds like an imperfect echo of the refrain
significantly modified, so as to beseech that God would
"turn" Himself, even as He had been implored to
"turn" his people. The purpose of His turning is
that He may "look and see" the condition of the
desolated vineyard, and thence be moved to interfere
for its restoration. The verse may be regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
closing one of the imperfectly developed strophes of
this last part; but it belongs in substance to the
following petitions, though in form it is more closely
connected with the preceding verses. The picture of
Israel's misery passes insensibly into prayer, and the
burden of that prayer is, first, that God would behold
the sad facts, as the preliminary to His acting in view
of them.</p>

<p>The last part (vv. 15-19) is prayer for God's help,
into which forces itself one verse (16), recurring to the
miseries of the nation. It bursts in like an outcrop
of lava, revealing underground disturbance and fires.
Surely that interruption is more pathetic and natural
than is the result obtained by the suggested transpositions.
The meaning of the word in ver. 15
rendered above "protect" is doubtful, and many commentators
would translate it as a noun, and regard it
as meaning "plant," or, as the A.V., "vineyard." The
verse would then depend on the preceding verb in
ver. 14, "visit." But this construction is opposed by
the copula (<i>and</i>) preceding, and it is best to render
"protect," with a slight change in the vocalisation.
There may be an allusion to Jacob's blessing in
ver. 15 <i>b</i>, for in it (Gen. xlix. 22) Joseph is called a
"fruitful bough"&mdash;lit., "son." If so, the figure of the
vine is retained in ver. 15 <i>b</i> as well as in <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>The apparent interruption of the petitions by ver. 16
is accounted for by the sharp pang that shot into the
psalmist's heart, when he recalled, in his immediately
preceding words, the past Divine acts, which seemed
so contradicted now. But the bitterness, though it
surges up, is overcome, and his petitions return to
their former strain in ver. 17, which pathetically takes
up, as it were, the broken thread, by repeating "right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
hand" from ver. 15 <i>a</i>, and "whom Thou madest strong
for Thyself" from ver. 15 <i>b</i>. Israel, not an individual,
is the "man of Thy right hand," in which designation,
coupled with "son," there may be an allusion to the
name of Benjamin (ver. 2), the "son of the right hand."
Human weakness and Divine strength clothing it are
indicated in that designation for Israel "the son of
man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself." The
inmost purpose of God's gifts is that their recipients
may be "the secretaries of His praise." Israel's sacred
calling, its own weakness, and the strength of the God
who endows it are all set forth, not now as lessons
to it, but as pleas with Him, whose gifts are without
repentance, and whose purposes cannot be foiled by
man's unworthiness or opposition.</p>

<p>The psalm closes with a vow of grateful adhesion
to God as the result of His renewed mercy. They
who have learned how bitter a thing it is to turn away
from God, and how blessed when He turns again to
them, and turns back their miseries and their sins, have
good reason for not again departing from Him. But if
they are wise to remember their own weakness, they will
not only humbly vow future faithfulness, but earnestly
implore continual help; since only the constant communication
of a Divine quickening will open their lips
to call upon God's name.</p>

<p>The refrain in its most expanded form closes the
psalm. Growing intensity of desire and of realisation
of the pleas and pledges hived in the name are
expressed by its successive forms,&mdash;God; God of
Hosts; Jehovah, God of Hosts. The faith that grasps
all that is contained in that full-toned name already
feels the light of God's face shining upon it, and is sure
that its prayer for salvation is not in vain.</p>

<p>The psalmist summons priests and people to a
solemn festival, commemorative of Israel's deliverance
from Egypt, and sets forth the lessons which that
deliverance teaches, the learning of which is the true
way of keeping the feast. There has been much
discussion as to which feast is in the psalmist's mind.
That of Tabernacles has been widely accepted as
intended, chiefly on the ground that the first day of
the month in which it occurred was celebrated by the
blowing of trumpets, as the beginning of the civil year.
This practice is supposed to account for the language
of ver. 3, which seems to imply trumpet-blowing both
at new and full moon. But, on other grounds, the
Passover is more likely to be intended, as the psalm
deals with the manifestations of Divine power attending
the beginning of the Exodus, which followed the
first Passover, as well as with those during the desert
sojourn, which alone were commemorated by the feast
of Tabernacles. True, we have no independent knowledge
of any trumpet-blowing on the first day of the
Passover month (Nisan); but Delitzsch and others
suggest that from this psalm it may be inferred "that
the commencement of each month, and more especially
the commencement of the month (Nisan), which
was at the same time the commencement of the ecclesiastical
year, was signalised by the blowing of horns."
On the whole, the Passover is most probably the feast
in question.</p>

<p>Olshausen, followed by Cheyne, regards the psalm
as made up of two fragments (vv. 1-5 <i>a</i>, and 5 <i>c</i>-16).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
But surely the exhortations and promises of the latter
portion are most relevant to the summons to the festival
contained in the former part, and there could be no
more natural way of preparing for the right commemoration
of the deliverance than to draw out its
lessons of obedience and to warn against departure
from the delivering God. Definiteness as to date is
unattainable. The presupposed existence of the full
Temple ceremonial shows that the psalm was not
written in exile, nor at a time of religious persecution.
Its warning against idolatry would be needless in a
post-exilic psalm, as no tendency thereto existed after
the return from captivity. But beyond such general
indications we cannot go. The theory that the psalm
is composed of two fragments exaggerates the difference
between the two parts into which it falls. These are
the summons to the feast (vv. 1-5), and the lessons of
the feast (vv. 6-16).</p>

<p>Delitzsch suggests that the summons in ver. 1 is
addressed to the whole congregation; that in ver. 2
to the Levites, the appointed singers and musicians;
and that in ver. 3 to the priests who are intrusted
with blowing the Shophar, or horn (Josh. vi. 4, and
2 Chron. xx. 28). One can almost hear the tumult
of joyful sounds, in which the roar of the multitude,
the high-pitched notes of singers, the deeper clash
of timbrels, the twanging of stringed instruments,
and the hoarse blare of rams' horns, mingle in concordant
discord, grateful to Eastern ears, however
unmusical to ours. The religion of Israel allowed and
required exuberant joy. It sternly rejected painting
and sculpture, but abundantly employed music, the
most ethereal of the arts, which stirs emotions and
longings too delicate and deep for speech. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
differences in form have necessarily attended the
progress from the worship of the Temple to that of the
Church, the free play of joyful emotion should mark
the latter even more than the former. Decorum is
good, but not if purchased by the loss of ringing
gladness. The psalmist's summons has a meaning
still.</p>

<p>The reason for it is given in vv. 4, 5 <i>a</i>. It&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the
feast (not the musical accompaniments)&mdash;is appointed
by God. The psalmist employs designations for it,
which are usually applied to "the word of the Lord";
statute, ordinance, testimony, being all found in Psalms
xix., cxix., with that meaning. A triple designation of
the people corresponds with these triple names for the
feast. <i>Israel</i>, <i>Jacob</i>, and <i>Joseph</i> are synonyms, the
use of the last of these having probably the same
force here as in the preceding psalm&mdash;namely, to
express the singer's longing for the restoration of the
shattered unity of the nation. The summons to the
feast is based, not only on Divine appointment, but
also on Divine purpose in that appointment. It was
"a testimony," a rite commemorative of a historical
fact, and therefore an evidence of it to future times.
There is no better proof of such a fact than a celebration
of it, which originates contemporaneously and
continues through generations. The feast in question
was thus simultaneous with the event commemorated,
as ver. 5 <i>b</i> tells. It was God, not Israel, as is often
erroneously supposed, who "went forth." For the
following preposition is not "from," which might refer
to the national departure, but "over" or "against,"
which cannot have such a reference, since Israel did
not, in any sense, go "over" or "against" the land.
God's triumphant forth-putting of power over the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
land, especially in the death of the first-born, on the
night of the Passover, is meant to be remembered for
ever, and is at once the fact commemorated by the
feast, and a reason for obeying His appointment of it.</p>

<p>So far the thoughts and language are limpid, but
ver. 5 <i>c</i> interrupts their clear flow. Who is the speaker
thus suddenly introduced? What is the "language"
(lit., lip) which he "knew not"? The explanation
implied by the A.V. and R.V., that the collective Israel
speaks, and that the reference is, as in Psalm cxiv. 1,
to the "strange language" of the Egyptians, is given
by most of the older authorities, and by Ewald and
Hengstenberg, but has against it the necessity for the
supplement "where," and the difficulty of referring the
"I" to the nation. The more usual explanation in
modern times is that the speaker is the psalmist, and
that the language which he hears is the voice of God,
the substance of which follows in the remainder of the
psalm. As in Job iv. 16 Eliphaz could not discern the
appearance of the mysterious form that stood before his
eyes, and thus its supernatural character is suggested,
so the psalmist hears an utterance of a hitherto
unknown kind, which he thus implies to have been
Divine. God Himself speaks, to impress the lessons
of the past, and to excite the thoughts and feelings
which would rightly celebrate the feast. The glad
noises of song, harp, and trumpet are hushed; the
psalmist is silent, to hear that dread Voice, and then
with lowly lips he repeats so much of the majestic
syllables as he could translate into words which it was
possible for a man to utter. The inner coherence of
the two parts of the psalm is, on this explanation, so
obvious, that there is no need nor room for the hypothesis
of two fragments having been fused into one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span></p>

<p>The Divine Voice begins with recapitulating the facts
which the feast was intended to commemorate&mdash;namely,
the act of emancipation from Egyptian bondage (ver. 6),
and the miracles of the wilderness sojourn (ver. 7).
The compulsory labour, from which God delivered the
people, is described by two terms, of which the former
(burden) is borrowed from Exodus, where it frequently
occurs (Exod. i. 11, v. 4, vi. 6), and the latter (basket)
is by some supposed to mean the wicker-work implement
for carrying, which the monuments show was in
use in Egypt (so LXX., etc.), and by others to mean
an earthen vessel, as "an example of the work in clay
in which the Israelites were engaged" (Hupfeld). The
years of desert wandering are summed up, in ver. 7,
as one long continuance of benefits from God. Whenever
they cried to Him in their trouble, He delivered
them. He spoke to them "from the secret place of
thunder" ("<i>My thunder-covert</i>," Cheyne). That expression
is generally taken to refer to the pillar of cloud, but
seems more naturally to be regarded as alluding to the
thick darkness, in which God was shrouded on Sinai,
when He spoke His law amid thunderings and lightnings.
"The proving at the waters of Meribah" is, according
to the connection and in harmony with Exod. xvii. 6,
to be regarded as a benefit. "It was meant to serve the
purpose of binding Israel still more closely to its God"
(Baethgen). It is usually assumed that, in this reference
to "the waters of Meribah," the two similar incidents
of the miraculous supply of water&mdash;one of which occurred
near the beginning of the forty years in the desert, at
"Massah and Meribah" (Exod. xvii. 7), and the other
at "the waters of Meribah," near Kadesh, in the
fortieth year&mdash;have been blended, or, as Cheyne says,
"confused." But there is no need to suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
there is any confusion, for the words of the psalm will
apply to the latter miracle as well as to the former, and,
if the former clause refers to the manifestations at
Sinai, the selection of an incident at nearly the end
of the wilderness period is natural. The whole stretch
of forty years is thereby declared to have been marked
by continuous Divine care. The Exodus was begun,
continued, and ended amid tokens of His watchful love.
The Selah bids the listener meditate on that prolonged
revelation.</p>

<p>That retrospect next becomes the foundation of a
Divine exhortation to the people, which is to be regarded
as spoken originally to Israel in the wilderness, as
ver. 11 shows. Perowne well designates these verses
(8-10) "a discourse within a discourse." They put
into words the meaning of the wilderness experience,
and sum up the laws spoken on Sinai, which they
in part repeat. The purpose of God's lavish benefits
was to bind Israel to Himself. "Hear, My people,"
reminds us of Deut. v. 1, vi. 4. "I will bear witness
to thee" here means rather solemn warning to, than
testifying against, the person addressed. With infinite
pathos, the tone of the Divine Speaker changes from
that of authority to pleading and the utterance of a
yearning wish, like a sigh. "Would that thou wouldest
hearken!" God desires nothing so earnestly as that,
but His Divine desire is tragically and mysteriously
foiled. The awful human power of resisting His voice
and of making His efforts vain, the still more awful
fact of the exercise of that power, were clear before
the psalmist, whose daring anthropopathy teaches a
deep lesson, and warns us against supposing that men
have to do with an impassive Deity. That wonderful
utterance of Divine wish is almost a parenthesis. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
gives a moment's glimpse into the heart of God, and
then the tone of command is resumed. "In ver. 9 the
keynote of the revelation of the law from Sinai is
given; the fundamental command which opens the
Decalogue demanded fidelity towards Jehovah, and forbade
idolatry, as the sin of sins" (Delitzsch). The
reason for exclusive devotion to God is based in ver. 10,
as in Exod. xx. 2, the fundamental passage, on His
act of deliverance, not on His sole Divinity. A theoretic
Monotheism would be cold; the consciousness
of benefits received from One Hand alone is the only
key that will unlock a heart's exclusive devotion and
lay it at His feet. And just as the commandment to
worship God alone is founded on His unaided delivering
might and love, so it is followed by the promise that
such exclusive adhesion to Him will secure the fulfilment
of the boldest wishes, and the satisfying of the
most clamant or hungry desires. "Open wide thy
mouth, and I will fill it." It is folly to go to strange
gods for the supply of needs, when God is able to give
all that every man can wish. We may be well content
to cleave to Him alone, since He alone is more than
enough for each and for all. Why should <i>they</i> waste
time and strength in seeking for supplies from many,
who can find all they need in One? They who put
Him to the proof, and find Him enough, will have, in
their experience of His sufficiency, a charm to protect
them from all vagrant desire to "go further and fare
worse." The best defence against temptations to stray
from God is the possession by experience, of His rich
gifts that meet all desires. That great saying teaches,
too, that God's bestowals are practically measured by
men's capacity and desire. The ultimate limit of them
is His own limitless grace; but the working limit in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
each individual is the individual's receptivity, of which
his expectancy and desire are determining factors.</p>

<p>In vv. 11, 12, the Divine Voice laments the failure
of benefits and commandments and promises to win
Israel to God. There is a world of baffled tenderness
and almost wondering rebuke in the designation of the
rebels as "My people." It would have been no cause
of astonishment if other nations had not listened; but
that the tribes bound by so many kindnesses should
have been deaf is a sad marvel. Who should listen
to "My voice" if "My people" do not? The penalty
of not yielding to God is to be left unyielding. The
worst punishment of sin is the prolongation and consequent
intensifying of the sin. A heart that wilfully
closes itself against God's pleadings brings on itself
the nemesis, that it becomes incapable of opening, as a
self-torturing Hindoo fakir may clench his fist so long,
that at last his muscles lose their power, and it remains
shut for his lifetime. The issue of such "stubbornness"
is walking in their own counsels, the practical
life being regulated entirely by self-originated and
God-forgetting dictates of prudence or inclination. He
who will not have the Divine Guide has to grope his way
as well as he can. There is no worse fate for a man
than to be allowed to do as he chooses. "The ditch,"
sooner or later, receives the man who lets his active
powers, which are in themselves blind, be led by his
understanding, which he has himself blinded by forbidding
it to look to the One Light of Life.</p>

<p>In ver. 13 the Divine Voice turns to address the
joyous crowd of festal worshippers, exhorting them to
that obedience which is the true keeping of the feast,
and holding forth bright promises of the temporal
blessings which, in accordance with the fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
conditions of Israel's prosperity, should follow thereon.
The sad picture of ancient rebellion just drawn influences
the language in this verse, in which "My
people," "hearken," and "walk" recur. The antithesis
to walking in one's own counsels is walking in God's
ways, suppressing native stubbornness, and becoming
docile to His guidance. The highest blessedness of
man is to have a will submissive to God's will, and to
carry out that submission in all details of life. Self-engineered
paths are always hard, and, if pursued to
the end, lead into the dark. The listening heart will
not lack guidance, and obedient feet will find God's
way the way of peace which steadily climbs to unfading
light.</p>

<p>The blessings attached in the psalm to such conformity
with God's will are of an external kind, as was
to be expected at the Old Testament stage of revelation.
They are mainly two&mdash;victory and abundance.
But the precise application of ver. 15 <i>b</i> is doubtful.
Whose "time" is to "endure for ever"? There is
much to be said in favour of the translation "that so
their time might endure for ever," as Cheyne renders,
and for understanding it, as he does, as referring to
the enemies who yield themselves to God, in order
that they "might be a never-exhausted people." But
to bring in the purpose of the enemies submission
is somewhat irrelevant, and the clause is probably
best taken to promise length of days to Israel.
In ver. 16 the sudden change of persons in a is
singular, and, according to the existing vocalisation,
there is an equally sudden change of tenses, which
induces Delitzsch and others to take the verse as
recurring to historical retrospect. The change to
the third person is probably occasioned, as Hupfeld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
suggests, by the preceding naming of Jehovah, or
may have been due to an error. Such sudden changes
are more admissible in Hebrew than with us, and are
very easily accounted for, when God is represented as
speaking. The momentary emergence of the psalmist's
personality would lead him to say "He," and the
renewed sense of being but the echo of the Divine Voice
would lead to the recurrence to the "I," in which God
speaks directly. The words are best taken as in line
with the other hypothetical promises in the preceding
verses. The whole verse looks back to Deut. xxxii.
13, 14. "Honey from the rock" is not a natural product;
but, as Hupfeld says, the parallel "oil out of the
flinty rock," which follows in Deuteronomy, shows that
"we are here, not on the ground of the actual, but of
the ideal," and that the expression is a hyperbole for
incomparable abundance. Those who hearken to God's
voice will have all desires satisfied and needs supplied.
They will find furtherance in hindrances, fertility in
barrenness; rocks will drop honey and stones will
become bread.</p>

<p>In Psalm 1. God is represented as gathering His

The former psalm begins at an earlier point of the
great Cause than this one does. In it, unnamed
messengers go forth to summons the nation; in this,
the first verse shows us the assembled congregation,
the accused, and the Divine Judge standing in "the
midst" in statuesque immobility. An awe-inspiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
pause intervenes, and then the silence is broken by
a mighty voice of reproof and admonition (vv. 2-4).
The speaker may be the psalmist, but the grand image
of God as judging loses much of its solemnity and
appropriateness, unless these stern rebukes and the
following verses till the end of ver. 7 are regarded
as His voice of judgment. Ver. 5 follows these rebukes
with "an indignant aside from the Judge" (Cheyne),
evoked by obstinate deafness to His words; and
vv. 6, 7, pronounce the fatal sentence on the accused,
who are condemned by their own refusal to hearken
to Divine remonstrances. Then, in ver. 8, after a pause
like that which preceded God's voice, the psalmist,
who has been a silent spectator, prays that what he
has heard in the inward ear, and seen with the inward
eye, may be done before the nations of the world, since
it all belongs to Him by right.</p>

<p>The scene pictured in ver. 1 has been variously
interpreted. "The congregation of God" is most
naturally understood according to the parallel in
Psalm l., and the familiar phrase "the congregation
of Israel" as being the assembled nation. Its interpretation
and that of the "gods" who are judged hang
together. If the assembly is the nation, the persons
at the bar can scarcely be other than those who have
exercised injustice on the nation. If, on the other
hand, the "gods" are ideal or real angelic beings, the
assembly will necessarily be a heavenly one. The use of
the expressions "The congregation of Jehovah" (Numb.
xxvii. 17, xxxi. 16; Josh. xxii. 16, 17) and "Thy
congregation" (Psalm lxxiv. 2) makes the former interpretation
the more natural, and therefore exercises some
influence in determining the meaning of the other
disputed word. The interpretation of "gods" as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
angels is maintained by Hupfeld; and Bleek, followed
by Cheyne, goes the fun length of regarding them
as patron angels of the nations. But, as Baethgen
says, "that angels should be punished with death
is a thought which lies utterly beyond the Old Testament
sphere of representation," and the incongruity
can hardly be reckoned to be removed by Cheyne's
remark, that, since angels are in other places represented
as punished, "it is only a step further" to say
that they are punished with death. If, however, these
"gods" are earthly rulers, the question still remains
whether they are Jewish or foreign judges? The
latter opinion is adopted chiefly on the ground of the
reference in ver. 8 to a world-embracing judicial act,
which, however, by no means compels its acceptance,
since it is entirely in accordance with the manner of
psalmists to recognise in partial acts of Divine retribution
the operation in miniature of the same Divine
power, which will one day set right all wrongs, and,
on occasion of the smaller manifestation of Divine
righteousness, to pray for a universal judgment. There
would be little propriety in summoning the national
assembly to behold judgments wrought on foreign
rulers, unless these alien oppressors were afflicting
Israel, of which there is no sure indications in the
psalm. The various expressions for the afflicted in
vv. 3, 4, are taken, by the supporters of the view that
the judges are foreigners, to mean the whole nation as
it groaned under their oppression, but there is nothing
to show that they do not rather refer to the helpless in
Israel.</p>

<p>Our Lord's reference to ver. 6 in John x. 34-38 is,
by the present writer, accepted as authoritatively
settling both the meaning and the ground of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
remarkable name of "gods" for human judges. It
does not need that we should settle the mystery of
His emptying Himself, or trace the limits of His human
knowledge, in order to be sure that He spoke truth
with authority, when He spoke on such a subject as
His own Divine nature, and the analogies and contrasts
between it and the highest human authorities. His
whole argument is worthless, unless the "gods" in the
psalm are men. He tells us why that august title is
applied to them&mdash;namely, because to them "the word
of God came." They were recipients of a Divine word,
constituting them in their office; and, in so far as they
discharged its duties, their decrees were God's word
ministered by them. That is especially true in a
theocratic state such as Israel, where the rulers are,
in a direct way, God's vicegerents, clothed by Him
with delegated authority, which they exercise under
His control. But it is also true about all who are
set in similar positions elsewhere. The office is sacred,
whatever its holders are.</p>

<p>The contents of the psalm need little remark. In
vv. 2-4 God speaks in stern upbraiding and command.
The abrupt pealing forth of the Divine Voice, without
any statement of who speaks, is extremely dramatic
and impressive. The judgment hall is filled with a
hushed crowd. No herald is needed to proclaim silence.
Strained expectance sits on every ear. Then the silence
is broken. These authoritative accents can come but
from one speaker. The crimes rebuked are those to
which rulers, in such a state of society as was in Israel,
are especially prone, and such as must have been well-nigh
universal at the time of the psalmist. They were
no imaginary evils against which these sharp arrows
were launched. These princes were like those gibbeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
for ever in Isa. 1.&mdash;loving gifts and following after
rewards, murderers rather than judges, and fitter to be
"rulers of Sodom" than of God's city. They had prostituted
their office by injustice, had favoured the rich
and neglected the poor, had been deaf to the cry of the
helpless, had steeled their hearts against the miseries
of the afflicted, and left them to perish in the gripe of
the wicked. Such is the indictment. Does it sound
applicable to angels?</p>

<p>For a moment the Divine Voice pauses. Will its
tones reach any consciences? No. There is no sign
of contrition among the judges, who are thus solemnly
being judged. Therefore God speaks again, as if
wondering, grieved, and indignant "at the blindness of
their hearts," as His Son was when His words met the
same reception from the same class. Ver. 5 might
almost be called a Divine lament over human impenitence,
ere the Voice swells into the fatal sentence.
One remembers Christ's tears, as He looked across the
valley to the city glittering in the morning sun. His
tears did not hinder His pronouncing its doom; nor
did His pronouncing its doom hinder His tears. These
judges were without knowledge. They walked in
darkness, because they walked in selfishness, and never
thought of God's judgment. Their gait was insolent,
as the form of the word "walk to and fro" implies.
And, since they who were set to be God's representatives
on earth, and to show some gleam of His justice
and compassion, were ministers of injustice and vicegerents
of evil, fostering what they should have crushed,
and crushing whom they should have fostered, the
foundations of society were shaken, and, unless these
were swept away, it would be dissolved into chaos.
Therefore the sentence must fall, as it does in vv. 6, 7.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
The grant of dignity is withdrawn. They are stripped
of their honours, as a soldier of his uniform before he
is driven from his corps. The judge's robe, which they
have smirched, is plucked off their shoulders, and they
stand as common men.</p>

<p>This psalm is a cry for help against a world
in arms. The failure of all attempts to point
to a period when all the allies here represented as
confederate against Israel were or could have been
united in assailing it, inclines one to suppose that the
enumeration of enemies is not history, but poetic idealisation.
The psalm would then be, not the memorial
of a fact, but the expression of the standing relation
between Israel and the outlying heathendom. The
singer masses together ancient and modern foes of
diverse nationalities and mutual animosities, and pictures
them as burying their enmities and bridging their
separations, and all animated by one fell hatred to
the Dove of God, which sits innocent and helpless in
the midst of them. There are weighty objections to
this view; but no other is free from difficulties even
more considerable. There are two theories which
divide the suffrages of commentators. The usual
assignment of date is to the league against Jehoshaphat
recorded in 2 Chron. xx. But it is hard to find that
comparatively small local confederacy of three peoples
in the wide-reaching alliance described in the psalm.
Chronicles enumerates the members of the league as
being the children of Moab and "the children of Ammon,
and with them some of the Ammonites," which last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
unmeaning designation should be read, as in the LXX.,
"the Me'unim." and adds to these Edom (2 Chron.
xx. 2, corrected text). Even if the contention of the
advocates of this date for the psalm is admitted, and
"the Me'unim" are taken to include the Arab tribes,
whom the psalmist calls Ishmaelites and Hagarenes,
there remains the fact that he names also Philistia,
Amalek, Tyre, and Asshur, none of whom is concerned
in the alliance against Jehoshaphat. It was, in fact,
confined to eastern and south-eastern nations, with
whom distant western tribes could have no common
interest. Nor is the other view of the circumstances
underlying the psalm free from difficulty. It advocates
a Maccabean date. In 1 Macc. v. it is recorded that the
nations round about were enraged at the restoration
of the altar and dedication of the Temple after its
pollution by Antiochus Epiphanes, and were ready to
break out in hostility. Cheyne points to the occurrence
in Maccabees of six of the ten names mentioned in the
psalm. But of the four not mentioned, two are Amalek
and Asshur, both of which had been blotted out of the
roll of nations long before the Maccabees' era. "The
mention of Amalek," says Cheyne, "is half-Haggadic,
half-antiquarian." But what should Haggadic or
antiquarian elements do in such a list? Asshur is
explained on this hypothesis as meaning Syria, which
is very doubtful, and, even if admitted, leaves unsolved
the difficulty that the subordinate place occupied by the
nation in question would not correspond to the importance
of Syria in the time of the Maccabees. Of the
two theories, the second is the more probable, but
neither is satisfactory; and the view already stated,
that the psalm does not refer to any actual alliance,
seems to the present writer the most probable. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
world is up in arms against God's people; and what
weapon has Israel? Nothing but prayer.</p>

<p>The psalm naturally falls into two parts, separated
by Selah, of which the first (vv. 1-8) describes Israel's
extremity, and the second (vv. 9-18) is its supplication.</p>

<p>The psalmist begins with earnest invocation of God's
help, beseeching Him to break His apparent inactivity
and silence. "Let there be no rest to Thee" is like
Isa. lxii. 6. God seems passive. It needs but His
Voice to break the dreary silence, and the foes will be
scattered. And there is strong reason for His intervention,
for they are <i>His</i> enemies, who riot and roar
like the hoarse chafing of an angry sea, for so the word
rendered "make a tumult" implies (Psalm xlvi. 3).
It is "Thy people" who are the object of their crafty
conspiracy, and it is implied that these are thus hated
because they <i>are</i> God's people. Israel's prerogative,
which evokes the heathen's rage, is the ground of
Israel's confidence and the plea urged to God by it.
Are we not Thy "hidden ones"? And shall a hostile
world be able to pluck us from our safe hiding-place
in the hollow of Thy hand? The idea of preciousness,
as well as that of protection, is included in the word.
Men store their treasures in secret places; God hides
His treasures in the "secret of His face," the "glorious
privacy of light" inaccessible. How vain are the
plotters' whisperings against such a people!</p>

<p>The conspiracy has for its aim nothing short of
blotting out the national existence and the very name
of Israel. It is therefore high-handed opposition to
God's counsel, and the confederacy is against <i>Him</i>.
The true antagonists are, not Israel and the world, but
God and the world. Calmness, courage, and confidence
spring in the heart with such thoughts. They who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
can feel that they are hid in God may look out, as from
a safe islet on the wildest seas, and fear nothing. And
all who will may hide in Him.</p>

<p>The enumeration of the confederates in vv. 6-8
groups together peoples who probably were never
really united for any common end. Hatred is a very
potent cement, and the most discordant elements may
be fused together in the fire of a common animosity.
What a motley assemblage is here! What could bring
together in one company Ishmaelites and Tyrians,
Moab and Asshur? The first seven names in the list
of allies had their seats to the east and south-east of
Palestine. Edom, Moab, Ammon, and Amalek were
ancestral foes, the last of which had been destroyed
in the time of Hezekiah (1 Chron. iv. 43). The mention
of descendants of Ishmael and Hagar, nomad Arab
tribes to the south and east, recalls their ancestors'
expulsion from the patriarchal family. Gebal is probably
the mountainous region to the south of the Dead
Sea. Then the psalmist turns to the west, to Philistia,
the ancient foe, and Tyre, "the two peoples of the
Mediterranean coast, which also appear in Amos (ch. i.;
<i>cf.</i> Joel iii.) as making common cause with the Edomites
against Israel" (Delitzsch). Asshur brings up the rear&mdash;a
strange post for it to occupy, to be reduced to be
an auxiliary to the "children of Lot," <i>i.e.</i> Moab and
Ammon. The ideal character of this muster-roll is
supported by this singular inferiority of position, as
well as by the composition of the allied force, and by
the allusion to the shameful origin of the two leading
peoples, which is the only reference to Lot besides the
narrative in Genesis.</p>

<p>The confederacy is formidable, but the psalmist does
not enumerate its members merely in order to emphasise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
Israel's danger. He is contrasting this miscellaneous
conglomeration of many peoples with the Almighty
One, against whom they are vainly banded. Faith
can look without a tremor on serried battalions of
enemies, knowing that one poor man, with God at his
back, outnumbers them all. Let them come from east
and west, south and north, and close round Israel;
God alone is mightier than they. So, after a pause
marked by Selah, in which there is time to let the
thought of the multitudinous enemies sink into the
soul, the psalm passes into prayer, which throbs with
confident assurance and anticipatory triumph. The
singer recalls ancient victories, and prays for their
repetition. To him, as to every devout man, to-day's
exigencies are as sure of Divine help as any yesterday's
were, and what God has done is pledge and specimen
of what He is doing and will do. The battle is left
to be waged by Him alone. The psalmist does not
seem to think of Israel's drawing sword, but rather
that it should stand still and see God fighting for it.
The victory of Gideon over Midian, to which Isaiah
also refers as the very type of complete conquest
(Isa. ix. 3), is named first, but thronging memories
drive it out of the singer's mind for a moment, while
he goes back to the other crushing defeat of Jabin and
Sisera at the hands of Barak and Deborah (Judg. iv., v.).
He adds a detail to the narrative in Judges, when he
localises the defeat at Endor, which lies on the eastern
edge of the great plain of Esdraelon. In ver. 11 he
returns to his first example of defeat&mdash;the slaughter of
Midian by Gideon. Oreb (raven) and Zeeb (wolf) were
in command of the Midianites, and were killed by the
Ephraimites in the retreat. Zebah and Zalmunnah
were kings of Midian, and fell by Gideon's own hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
(Judg. viii. 21). The psalmist bases his prayer for
such a dread fate for the foes on their insolent purpose
and sacrilegious purpose of making me dwellings (or,
possibly, the pastures) of God their own property.
Not because the land and its peaceful homes belonged
to the suppliant and his nation, but because they were
God's, does he thus pray. The enemies had drawn
the sword; it was permissible to pray that they might
fall by the sword, or by some Divine intervention,
since such was the only way of defeating their God-insulting
plans.</p>

<p>The psalm rises to high poetic fervour and imaginative
beauty in the terrible petitions of vv. 13-16. The
word rendered "whirling dust" in ver. 13 is somewhat
doubtful. It literally means <i>a rolling thing</i>, but what
particular thing of the sort is difficult to determine.
The reference is perhaps to "spherical masses of dry
weeds which course over the plains." Thomson ("Land
and Book," 1870, p. 563) suggests the wild artichoke,
which, when ripe, forms a globe of about a foot in
diameter. "In autumn the branches become dry and
as light as a feather, the parent stem breaks off at the
ground, and the wind carries these vegetable globes
whithersoever it pleaseth. At the proper season thousands
of them come scudding over the plain, rolling,
leaping, bounding." So understood, the clause would
form a complete parallel with the next, which compares
the fleeing foe to stubble, not, of course, rooted, but
loose and whirled before the wind. The metaphor of
ver. 14 is highly poetic, likening the flight of the foe
to the swift rush of a forest fire, which licks up (for so
the word rendered <i>scorches</i> means) the woods on the
hillsides, and leaves a bare, blackened space. Still
more terrible is the petition in ver. 15, which asks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
that God Himself should chase the flying remnants,
and beat them down, helpless and panic-stricken, with
storm and hurricane, as He did the other confederacy
of Canaanitish kings, when they fled down the pass of
Beth-Horon, and "Jehovah cast down great stones on
them from heaven" (Josh. x. 10, 11).</p>

<p>But there is a deeper desire in the psalmist's heart
than the enemies' destruction. He wishes that they
should be turned into God's friends, and he wishes for
their chastisement as the means to that end. "That
they may seek Thy face, Jehovah," is the sum of his
aspirations, as it is the inmost meaning of God's
punitive acts. The end of the judgment of the world,
which is continually going on by means of the history
of the world, is none other than what this psalmist
contemplated as the end of the defeat of that confederacy
of God's enemies&mdash;that rebels should seek His face,
not in enforced submission, but with true desire to
sun themselves in its light, and with heart-felt acknowledgment
of His Name as supreme through all the
earth. The thought of God as standing alone in His
majestic omnipotence, while a world is vainly arrayed
against Him, which we have traced in vv. 5-7, is
prominent in the close of the psalm. The language of
ver. 18 is somewhat broken, but its purport is plain,
and its thought is all the more impressive for the
irregularity of construction. God alone is the Most
High. He is revealed to men by His Name. It stands
alone, as He in His nature does. The highest good
of men is to know that that sovereign Name is unique
and high above all creatures, hostile or obedient.
Such knowledge is God's aim in punishment and
blessing. Its universal extension must be the deepest
wish of all who have for themselves learned how strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
a fortress against a world in arms that Name is; and
their desires for the foes of God and themselves are not
in harmony with God's heart, nor with this psalmist's
song, unless they are, that His enemies may be led, by
salutary defeat of their enterprises and experience of
the weight of God's hand, to bow, in loving obedience,
low before the Name which, whether they recognise
the fact or not, is high above an the earth.</p>

which found pathetic expression in Psalms xlii.,
xliii., inspire this psalm. Like these, it is ascribed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
the superscription to the Korachites, whose office of
door-keepers in the Temple seems alluded to in ver. 10.
To infer, however, identity of authorship from similarity
of tone is hazardous. The differences are as obvious
as the resemblances. As Cheyne well says, "the
notes of the singer of Psalms xlii., xliii., are here transposed
into a different key. It is still 'Te saluto, te
suspiro,' but no longer 'De longinquo te saluto' (to
quote Hildebert)." The longings after God and the
sanctuary, in the first part of the psalm, do not
necessarily imply exile from the latter, for they may be
felt when we are nearest to Him, and are, in fact, an
element in that nearness. It is profitless to inquire
what were the singer's circumstances. He expresses
the perennial emotions of devout souls, and his words
are as enduring and as universal as the aspirations
which they so perfectly express. No doubt the psalm
identifies enjoyment of God's presence with the worship
of the visible sanctuary more closely than we have
to do, but the true object of its longing is God, and
so long as spirit is tied to body the most spiritual
worship will be tied to form. The psalm may serve
as a warning against premature attempts to dispense
with outward aids to inward communion.</p>

<p>It is divided into three parts by the Selahs. The
last verse of the first part prepares the way for the
first of the second, by sounding the note of "Blessed
they," etc., which is prolonged in ver. 5, The last
verse of the second part (ver. 8) similarly prepares
for the first of the third (ver. 9) by beginning the
prayer which is prolonged there. In each part there
is a verse pronouncing blessing on Jehovah's worshippers,
and the variation in the designations of these
gives the key to the progress of thought in the psalm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
First comes the blessing on those who dwell in God's
house (ver. 4), and that abiding is the theme of the
first part. The description of those who are thus
blessed is changed, in the second strophe, to "those
in whose heart are the [pilgrim] ways," and the joys
of the progress of the soul towards God are the theme
of that strophe. Finally, for dwelling in and journeying
towards the sanctuary is substituted the plain
designation of "the man that trusts in Thee," which
trust is the impulse to following after God and the
condition of dwelling with Him; and its joys are the
theme of the third part.</p>

<p>The man who thus interpreted his own psalm had
no unworthy conception of the relation between outward
nearness to the sanctuary, and inward communion
with the God who dwelt there. The psalmist's
yearning for the Temple was occasioned by his longing
for God. It was God's presence there which gave it
all its beauty. Because they were "Thy tabernacles,"
he felt them to be lovely and lovable, for the word
implies both. The abrupt exclamation beginning the
psalm is the breaking into speech of thought which
had long increased itself in silence. The intensity
of his desires is expressed very strikingly by two
words, of which the former (<i>longs</i>) literally means
<i>grows pale</i>, and the latter <i>fails</i>, or <i>is consumed</i>. His
whole being, body and spirit, is one cry for the living
God. The word rendered "cry out" is usually
employed for the shrill cry of joy, and that meaning
is by many retained here. But the cognate noun is
not infrequently employed for any loud or high-pitched
call, especially for fervent prayer (Psalm lxxxviii. 2),
and it is better to suppose that this clause expresses
emotion substantially parallel to that of the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
one, than that it makes a contrast to it. "The living
God" is an expression only found in Psalm xlii., and
is one of the points of resemblance between it and
this psalm. That Name is more than a contrast with
the gods of the heathen. It lays bare the reason for
the psalmist's longings. By communion with Him
who possesses life in its fulness, and is its fountain
for all that live, he will draw supplies of that "life
whereof our veins are scant." Nothing short of a real,
living Person can slake the immortal thirst of the soul,
made after God's own life, and restless till it rests
in Him. The surface current of this singer's desires
ran towards the sanctuary; the depth of them set
towards God; and, for the stage of revelation at which
he stood, the deeper was best satisfied through the
satisfaction of the more superficial. The one is
modified by the progress of Christian enlightenment,
but the other remains eternally the same. Alas that
the longings of Christian souls for fellowship with
God should be so tepid, as compared with the sacred
passion of desire which has found imperishable utterance
in these glowing and most sincere words!</p>

<p>Ver. 3 has been felt to present grammatical difficulties,
which need not detain us here. The easiest
explanation is that the happy, winged creatures who
have found resting-places are contrasted by the psalmist
with himself, seeking, homeless amid creation, for his
haven of repose. We have to complete the somewhat
fragmentary words with some supplement before
"Thine altars," such as "So would I find," or the like.
To suppose that he represents the swallows as actually
nesting on the altar is impossible, and, if the latter
clauses are taken to describe the places where the
birds housed and bred, there is nothing to suggest the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
purpose for which the reference to them is introduced.
If, on the other hand, the poet looks with a poet's eye
on these lower creatures at rest in secure shelters, and
longs to be like them, in his repose in the home which
his deeper wants make necessary for him, a noble
thought is expressed with adequate poetic beauty.
"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air roosting-places,
but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head."
All creatures find environment suited to their need, and
are at rest in it, man walks like a stranger on earth,
and restlessly seeks for rest. Where but in God is
it to be found? Who that seeks it in Him shall fail
to find it? What their nests are to the swallows, God
is to man. The solemnity of the direct address to God
at the close of ver. 3 would be out of place if the altar
were the dwelling of the birds, but is entirely natural if
the psalmist is thinking of the Temple as the home of
his spirit. By the accumulation of sacred and dear
names, and by the lovingly reiterated "my," which
claims personal relation to God, he deepens his conviction
of the blessedness which would be his, were he
in that abode of his heart, and lingeringly tells his
riches, as a miser might delight to count his gold, piece
by piece.</p>

<p>The first part closes with an exclamation which
gathers into one all-expressive word the joy of communion
with God. They who have it are "blessed,"
with something more sacred and lasting than happiness,
with something deeper and more tranquil than joy, even
with a calm delight, not altogether unlike the still, yet
not stagnant, rest of supreme felicity which fills the life
of the living and ever-blessed God. That thought is
prolonged by the music.</p>

<p>The second strophe (vv. 5-8) is knit to the first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
chain-wise, by taking up again the closing strain,
"Blessed the man!" But it turns the blessedness in
another direction. Not only are they blessed who have
found their rest in God, but so also are they who are
seeking it. The goal is sweet, but scarcely less sweet
are the steps towards it. The fruition of God has
delights beyond all that earth can give, but the desire
after Him, too, has delights of its own. The experiences
of the soul seeking God in His sanctuary are
here cast into the image of pilgrim bands going up to
the Temple. There may be local allusions in the details.
The "ways" in ver. 5 are the pilgrims' paths
to the sanctuary. Hupfeld calls the reading "ways"
senseless, and would substitute "trust"; but such a
change is unnecessary, and tasteless. The condensed
expression is not too condensed to be intelligible, and
beautifully describes the true pilgrim spirit. They who
are touched with that desire which impels men to
"seek a better country, that is an heavenly," and to take
flight from Time's vanities to the bosom of God, have
ever "the ways" in their hearts. They count the
moments lost during which they linger, or are anywhere
but on the road. Amid calls of lower duties and distractions
of many sorts, their desires turn to the path
to God. Like some nomads brought into city life, they
are always longing to escape. The caged eagle sits on
the highest point of his prison, and looks with filmed
eye to the free heavens. Hearts that long for God
have an irrepressible instinct stinging them to ever-new
attainments. The consciousness of "not having already
attained" is no pain, when the hope of attaining is
strong. Rather, the very blessedness of life lies in the
sense of present imperfection, the effort for completeness,
and the assurance of reaching it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>Ver. 6 is highly imaginative and profoundly true. If
a man has "the ways" in his heart, he will pass
through "the valley of weeping," and turn it into a
"place of fountains." His very tears will fill the wells.
Sorrow borne as a help to pilgrimage changes into
joy and refreshment. The remembrance of past grief
nourishes the soul which is aspiring to God. God
puts our tears into His bottle; we lose the benefit
of them, and fail to discern their true intent, unless
we gather them into a well, which may refresh us
in many a weary hour thereafter. If we do, there will
be another source of fertility, plentifully poured out
upon our life's path. "The early rain covers it with
blessings." Heaven-descended gifts will not be wanting,
nor the smiling harvests which they quicken and
mature. God meets the pilgrims' love and faith with
gently falling influences, which bring forth rich fruit.
Trials borne aright bring down fresh bestowments of
power for fruitful service. Thus possessed of a charm
which transforms grief, and recipients of strength
from on high, the pilgrims are not tired by travel, as
others are, but grow stronger day by day, and their
progressive increase in vigour is a pledge that they
will joyously reach their journey's end, and stand in
the courts of the Lord's house. The seekers after
God are superior to the law of decay. It may affect
their physical powers, but they are borne up by an
unfulfilled and certain hope, and reinvigorated by continual
supplies from above; and therefore, though in
their bodily frame they, like other men, faint and grow
weary, they shall not utterly fail, but, waiting on Jehovah,
"will renew their strength." The fabled fountain
of perpetual youth rises at the foot of God's throne,
and its waters flow to meet those who journey thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are the elements of the blessedness of those
who seek God's presence; and with that great promise
of certain finding of the good and the God whom they
seek, the description and the strophe properly ends.
But just as the first part prepared the way for the
second, so the second does for the third, by breaking
forth into prayer. No wonder that the thoughts which
he has been dwelling on should move the singer to supplication
that these blessednesses may be his. According
to some, ver. 8 is the prayer of the pilgrim on arriving
in the Temple, but it is best taken as the psalmist's own.</p>

<p>The final part begins with invocation. In ver. 9
"our shield" is in apposition to "God," not the object
to "behold." It anticipates the designation of God
in ver. 11. But why should the prayer for "Thine
anointed" break in upon the current of thought? Are
we to say that the psalmist "completes his work by
some rhythmical but ill-connected verses" (Cheyne)?
There is a satisfactory explanation of the apparently
irrelevant petition, if we accept the view that the psalm,
like its kindred Psalms xlii., xliii., was the work of a companion
of David's in his flight. If so, the king's restoration
would be the condition of satisfying the psalmist's
longing for the sanctuary. Any other hypothesis as
to his date and circumstances fails to supply a connecting
link between the main subject of the psalm and
this petition. The "For" at the beginning of ver. 10
favours such a view, since it gives the delights of the
house of the Lord, and the psalmist's longing to share
in them, as the reasons for his prayer that Jehovah
would look upon the face of His anointed. In that
verse he glides back to the proper theme of the psalm.
Life is to be estimated, not according to its length,
but according to the richness of its contents. Time is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
elastic. One crowded moment is better than a millennium
of languid years. And nothing fills life so full
or stretches the hours to hold so much of real living,
as communion with God, which works, on those who
have plunged into its depths, some assimilation to the
timeless life of Him with whom "one day is as a
thousand years." There may be a reference to the
Korachites' function of door-keepers, in that touchingly
beautiful choice of the psalmist's, rather to lie on the
threshold of the Temple than to dwell in the tents
of wickedness. Whether there is or not, the sentiment
breathes sweet humility, and deliberate choice. Just
as the poet has declared that the briefest moment of
communion is in his sight to be preferred to years
of earthly delight, so he counts the humblest office in
the sanctuary, and the lowest place there, if only it
is within the doorway, as better than aught besides.
The least degree of fellowship with God has delights
superior to the greatest measure of worldly joys. And
this man, knowing that, chose accordingly. How many
of us know it, and yet cannot say with him, "Rather
would I lie on the door-sill of the Temple than sit in
the chief places of the world's feasts!"</p>

<p>Such a choice is the only rational one. It is the
choice of supreme good, correspondent to man's deepest
needs, and lasting as his being. Therefore the psalmist
vindicates his preference, and encourages himself in it,
by the thoughts in ver. 11, which he introduces with
"For." Because God is what He is, and gives what
He gives, it is the highest wisdom to take Him for our
true good, and never to let Him go. He is "sun and
shield." This is the only place in which He is directly
called a sun, though the idea conveyed is common. He
is "the master light of all our seeing," the fountain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
warmth, illumination, and life. His beams are too bright
for human eyes to gaze on, but their effluence is the joy
of creation. They who look to Him "shall not walk
in darkness, but shall have the light of life." What
folly to choose darkness rather than light, and, when
that Sun is high in the heavens, ready to flood our
hearts with its beams, to prefer to house ourselves
in gloomy caverns of our own sad thoughts and evil
doings! Another reason for the psalmist's choice is
that God is a shield. (Compare ver. 9.) Who that
knows the dangers and foes that cluster thick round
every life can wisely refuse to shelter behind that
ample and impenetrable buckler? It is madness to
stand in the open field, with arrows whizzing invisible
all round, when one step, one heartfelt desire, would
place that sure defence between us and every peril.
God being such, "grace and glory" will flow from
Him to those who seek Him. These two are given
simultaneously, not, as sometimes supposed, in succession,
as though grace were the sum of gifts for earth,
and glory the all-comprehending expression for the
higher bestowments of heaven. The psalmist thinks
that both are possessed here. <i>Grace</i> is the sum of God's
gifts, coming from His loving regard to His sinful and
inferior creatures. <i>Glory</i> is the reflection of His own
lustrous perfection, which irradiates lives that are turned
to Him, and makes them shine, as a poor piece of
broken pottery will, when the sunlight falls on it.
Since God is the sum of all good, to possess Him is to
possess it all. The one gift unfolds into all things
lovely and needful. It is the raw material, as it were,
out of which can be shaped, according to transient and
multiform needs, everything that can be desired or can
bless a soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<p>But high as is the psalmist's flight of mystic devotion,
he does not soar so far as to lose sight of plain
morality, as mystics have often been apt to do. It is
the man who walks in his integrity who may hope to
receive these blessings. "Without holiness no man
shall see the Lord"; and neither access to His house
nor the blessings flowing from His presence can belong
to him who is faithless to his own convictions of duty.
The pilgrim paths are paths of righteousness. The
psalmist's last word translates his metaphors of dwelling
in and travelling towards the house of Jehovah into
their simple meaning, "Blessed is the man that <i>trusteth</i>
in Thee." That trust both seeks and finds God. There
has never been but one way to His presence, and that
is the way of trust. "I am the way.... No man
cometh to the Father but by Me." So coming, we
shall find, and then shall seek more eagerly and find
more fully, and thus shall possess at once the joys of
fruition and of desires always satisfied, never satiated,
but continually renewed.</p>

<p>The outstanding peculiarity of this psalm is its
sudden transitions of feeling. Beginning with
exuberant thanksgiving for restoration of the nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
(vv. 1-3), it passes, without intermediate gradations,
to complaints of God's continued wrath and entreaties
for restoration (vv. 4-7), and then as suddenly rises
to joyous assurance of inward and outward blessings.
The condition of the exiles returned from Babylon
best corresponds to such conflicting emotions. The
book of Nehemiah supplies precisely such a background
as fits the psalm. A part of the nation had returned
indeed, but to a ruined city, a fallen Temple, and a
mourning land, where they were surrounded by jealous
and powerful enemies. Discouragement had laid hold
on the feeble company; enthusiasm had ebbed away;
the harsh realities of their enterprise had stripped off
its imaginative charm; and the mass of the returned
settlers had lost heart as well as devout faith. The
psalm accurately reflects such a state of circumstances
and feelings, and may, with some certitude, be assigned,
as it is by most commentators, to the period of return
from exile.</p>

<p>It falls into three parts, of increasing length,&mdash;the
first, of three verses (vv. 1-3), recounts God's acts of
mercy already received; the second, of four verses
(vv. 4-7), is a plaintive prayer in view of still remaining
national afflictions; and the third, of six
verses, a glad report by the psalmist of the Divine
promises which his waiting ear had heard, and which
might well quicken the most faint-hearted into triumphant
hope.</p>

<p>In the first strophe one great fact is presented in a
threefold aspect, and traced wholly to Jehovah. "Thou
hast turned back the captivity of Jacob." That expression
is sometimes used in a figurative sense for any
restoration of prosperity, but is here to be taken
literally. Now, as at first, the restored Israel, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
their ancestors under Joshua, had not won the land
by their own arm, but "because God had a favour
unto them," and had given them favour in the eyes of
those who carried them captive. The restoration of
the Jews, seen from the conqueror's point of view, was
a piece of state policy, but from that of the devout
Israelite was the result of God's working upon the
heart of the new ruler of Babylon. The fact is stated
in ver. 1; a yet more blessed fact, of which it is most
blessed as being a token, is declared in ver. 2.</p>

<p>The psalmist knows that captivity had been chastisement,
the issue of national sin. Therefore he is sure
that restoration is the sign of forgiveness. His thoughts
are running in the same line as in Isa. xl. 2, where the
proclamation to Jerusalem that her iniquity is pardoned
is connected with the assurance that her hard service
is accomplished. He uses two significant words for
pardon, both of which occur in Psalm xxxii. In ver. 2 <i>a</i>
sin is regarded as a weight pressing down the nation,
which God's mercy lifts off and takes away; in ver. 2 <i>b</i>
it is conceived of as a hideous stain or foulness, which
His mercy hides, so that it is no longer an offence to
heaven. Ver. 3 ventures still deeper into the sacred
recesses of the Divine nature, and traces the forgiveness,
which in act had produced so happy a change in Israel's
position, to its source in a change in God's disposition.
"Thou hast drawn in all Thy wrath," as a man does
his breath, or, if the comparison may be ventured, as
some creature armed with a sting retracts it into its
sheath. "Thou hast turned Thyself from the glow
of Thine anger" gives the same idea under another
metaphor. The word turn has a singular fascination
for this psalmist. He uses it five times (vv. 1, 3, 4, 6&mdash;<i>lit.</i>,
wilt Thou not turn, quicken us?&mdash;and 8). God's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
turning from His anger is the reason for Israel's returning
from captivity.</p>

<p>The abruptness of the transition from joyous thanksgiving
to the sad minor of lamentation and supplication
is striking, but most natural, if the psalmist was one of
the band of returning exiles, surrounded by the ruins
of a happier past, and appalled by the magnitude of the
work before them, the slenderness of their resources,
and the fierce hostility of their neighbours. The
prayer of ver. 4, "Turn us," is best taken as using
the word in the same sense as in ver. 1, where God is
said to have "turned" the captivity of Jacob. What
was there regarded as accomplished is here conceived
of as still to be done. That is, the restoration was
incomplete, as we know that it was, both in regard to
the bulk of the nation, who still remained in exile, and
in regard to the depressed condition of the small part
of it which had gone back to Palestine. In like manner
the petitions of ver. 5 look back to ver. 3, and pray that
the anger which there had been spoken of as passed
may indeed utterly cease. The partial restoration of
the people implied, in the psalmist's view, a diminution
rather than a cessation of God's punitive wrath, and
he beseeches Him to complete that which He had
begun.</p>

<p>The relation of the first to the second strophe is
not only that of contrast, but the prayers of the latter
are founded upon the facts of the former, which constitute
both grounds for the suppliant's hope of answer
and pleas with God. He cannot mean to deliver by
halves. The mercies received are incomplete; and His
work must be perfect. He cannot be partially reconciled,
nor have meant to bring His people back to
the land, and then leave them to misery. So the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
contrast between the bright dawning of the Return
and its clouded day is not wholly depressing; for the
remembrance of what has been heartens for the assurance
that what is shall not always be, but will be
followed by a future more correspondent to God's purpose
as shown in that past. When we are tempted
to gloomy thoughts by the palpable incongruities
between God's ideals and man's realisation of them, we
may take a hint from this psalmist, and, instead of
concluding that the ideal was a phantasm, argue with
ourselves that the incomplete actual will one day give
way to the perfect embodiment. God leaves no work
unfinished. He never leaves off till He has done.
His beginnings guarantee congruous endings. He
does not half withdraw His anger; and, if He seems
to do so, it is only because men have but half turned
from their sins. This psalm is rich in teaching as to
the right way of regarding the incompleteness of great
movements which, in their incipient stages, were
evidently of God. It instructs us to keep the Divine
intervention which started them clearly in view; to
make the shortcomings, which mar them, a subject of
lowly prayer; and to be sure that all which He begins
He will finish, and that the end will fully correspond to
the promise of the beginning. A "day of the Lord"
which rose in brightness may cloud over as its hours
roll, but "at eventide it shall be light," and none of the
morning promise will be unfulfilled.</p>

<p>The third strophe (vv. 8-13) brings solid hopes,
based upon Divine promises, to bear on present discouragements.
In ver. 8 the psalmist, like Habakkuk
(ii. 1), encourages himself to listen to what God will
speak. The word "I will hear" expresses resolve or
desire, and might be rendered <i>Let me hear</i>, or <i>I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
hear</i>. Faithful prayer will always be followed by
patient and faithful waiting for response from God.
God will not be silent, when His servant appeals to
Him with recognition of His past mercies, joined with
longing that these may be perfected. No voice will
break the silence of the heavens; but, in the depths
of the waiting soul, there will spring a sweet assurance
which comes from God, and is really His answer to
prayer, telling the suppliant that "He will speak peace
to His people," and warning them not to turn away
from Him to other helps, which is folly. "His favoured
ones" seems here to be meant as coextensive with
"His people." Israel is regarded as having entered
into covenant relations with God; and the designation
is the pledge that what God speaks will be "peace."
That word is to be taken in its widest sense, as meaning,
first and chiefly, peace with Him, who has "turned
Himself from His anger"; and then, generally, well-being
of all kinds, outward and inward, as a consequence
of that rectified relation with God.</p>

<p>The warning of ver. 8 <i>c</i> is thought by some to be out
of place, and an emendation has been suggested, which
requires little change in the Hebrew&mdash;namely, "to
those who have turned their hearts towards Him."
This reading is supported by the LXX.; but the
warning is perfectly appropriate, and carries a large
truth&mdash;that the condition of God's speaking of peace is
our firm adherence to Him. Once more the psalmist
uses his favourite word "turn." God had turned the
captivity; He had turned Himself from His anger;
the psalmist had prayed Him to turn or restore the
people, and to turn and revive them, and now He
warns against turning again to folly. There is always
danger of relapse in those who have experienced God's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
delivering mercy. There is a blessed turning, when
they are brought from the far-off land to dwell near
God. But there is a possible fatal turning away from
the Voice that speaks peace, and the Arm that brings
salvation, to the old distance and bondage. Strange
that any ears, which have heard the sweetness of His
still small Voice whispering Peace, should wish to stray
where it cannot be heard! Strange that the warning
should ever be required, and tragic that it should so
often be despised!</p>

<p>After the introductory ver. 8, the substance of what
Jehovah spoke to the psalmist is proclaimed in the
singer's own words. The first assurance which the
psalmist drew from the Divine word was that God's
salvation, the whole fulness of His delivering grace
both in regard to external and in inward evils, is ever
near to them that fear Him. "Salvation" here is to
be taken in its widest sense. It means, negatively,
deliverance from all possible evils, outward and inward;
and, positively, endowment with all possible good, both
for body and spirit. With such fulness of complete
blessings, they, and they only, who keep near to God,
and refuse to turn aside to foolish confidences, shall be
enriched. That is the inmost meaning of what God
said to the psalmist; and it is said to all. And that
salvation being thus possessed, it would be possible for
"glory"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the manifest presence of God, as in the
Shechinah&mdash;to tabernacle in the land. The condition
of God's dwelling with men is their acceptance of His
salvation. That purifies hearts to be temples.</p>

<p>The lovely personifications in vv. 10-13 have
passed into Christian poetry and art, but are not
clearly apprehended when they are taken to describe
the harmonious meeting and co-operation, in Christ's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
great work, of apparently opposing attributes of the
Divine nature. No such thoughts are in the psalmist's
mind. Loving-kindness and Faithfulness or Troth are
constantly associated in Scripture as Divine attributes.
Righteousness and Peace are as constantly united,
as belonging to the perfection of human character.
Ver. 10 seems to refer to the manifestation of God's
Loving-kindness and Faithfulness in its first clause,
and to the exhibition of His people's virtues and consequent
happiness in its second. In all God's dealings
for His people, His Loving-kindness blends with Faithfulness.
In all His people's experience Righteousness
and Peace are inseparable. The point of the assurance
in ver. 10 is that heaven and earth are blended
in permanent amity. These four radiant angels "dwell
in the land." Then, in ver. 11, there comes a beautiful
inversion of the two pairs of personifications, of
each of which one member only reappears. Troth or
Faithfulness, which in ver. 10 came into view principally
as a Divine attribute, in ver. 11 is conceived of
as a human virtue. It "springs out of the earth"&mdash;that
is, is produced among men. All human virtue is
an echo of the Divine, and they who have received into
their hearts the blessed results of God's Faithfulness
will bring forth in their lives fruits like it in kind.
Similarly, Righteousness, which in ver. 10 was mainly
viewed as a human excellence, here appears as dwelling
in and looking down from heaven, like a gracious
angel smiling on the abundance of Faithfulness which
springs from earth. Thus "the bridal of the earth
and sky" is set forth in these verses.</p>

<p>The same idea is further presented in ver. 12, in
its most general form. God gives that which is good,
both outward and inward blessings, and, thus fructified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
by bestowments from above, earth yields her increase.
His gifts precede men's returns. Without sunshine
and rain there are no harvests. More widely still,
God gives first before He asks. He does not gather
where He has not strawed, nor reap what He has
not sown. Nor does He only sow, but He "blesses the
springing thereof"; and to Him should the harvest be
rendered. He gives before we can give. Isa. xlv. 8
is closely parallel, representing in like manner the
co-operation of heaven and earth, in the new world
of Messianic times.</p>

<p>In ver. 13 the thought of the blending of heaven
and earth, or of Divine attributes as being the foundation
and parents of their human analogues, is still more
vividly expressed. Righteousness, which in ver. 10
was regarded as exercised by men, and in ver. 11 as
looking down from heaven, is now represented both
as a herald preceding God's royal progress, and as
following in His footsteps. The last clause is rendered
in different ways, which all have the same general sense.
Probably the rendering above is best: "Righteousness
shall make His footsteps a way"&mdash;that is, for men to
walk in. All God's workings among men, which are
poetically conceived as His way, have stamped on them
Righteousness. That strong angel goes before Him
to clear a path for Him, and trace the course which He
shall take. That is the imaginative expression of the
truth&mdash;that absolute, inflexible Righteousness guides all
the Divine acts. But the same Righteousness, which
precedes, also follows Him, and points His footsteps
as the way for us. The incongruity of this double
position of God's herald makes the force of the thought
greater. It is the poetical embodiment of the truth,
that the perfection of man's character and conduct lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
in his being an "imitator of God," and that, however
different in degree, our righteousness must be based
on His. What a wonderful thought that is, that the
union between heaven and earth is so close that God's
path is our way! How deep into the foundation of
ethics the psalmist's glowing vision pierces! How
blessed the assurance that God's Righteousness is revealed
from heaven to make men righteous!</p>

<p>Our psalm needs the completion, which tells of that
gospel in which "the Righteousness of God from faith
is revealed for faith." In Jesus the "glory" has
tabernacled among men. He has brought heaven and
earth together. In Him God's Loving-kindness and
Faithfulness have become denizens of earth, as never
before. In Him heaven has emptied its choicest good
on earth. Through Him our barrenness and weeds
are changed into harvests of love, praise, and service.
In Him the Righteousness of God is brought near;
and, trusting in Him, each of us may tread in His
footsteps, and have His Righteousness fulfilled in us
"who walk, not after the flesh, but after the spirit."</p>

<p>This psalm is little more than a mosaic of quotations
and familiar phrases of petition. But it is
none the less individual, nor is the psalmist less heavily
burdened, or less truly beseeching and trustful, because
he casts his prayer into well-worn words. God does
not give "originality" to every devout man; and He
does not require it as a condition of accepted prayer.
Humble souls, who find in more richly endowed men's
words the best expression of their own needs, may be
encouraged by such a psalm. Critics may think little
of it, as a mere cento; but God does not refuse to bow
His ear, though He is asked to do so in borrowed
words. A prayer full of quotations may be heartfelt,
and then it will be heard and answered. This psalmist
has not only shown his intimate acquaintance with
earlier devotional words, but he has woven his garland
with much quiet beauty, and has blended its flowers
into a harmony of colour all his own.</p>

<p>There is no fully developed strophical arrangement
but there is a discernible flow of thought, and the psalm
may be regarded as falling into three parts.</p>

<p>The first of these (vv. 1-5) is a series of petitions,
each supported by a plea. The petitions are the well-worn
ones which spring from universal need, and there
is a certain sequence in them. They begin with "Bow
down Thine ear," the first of a suppliant's desires, which,
as it were, clears the way for those which follow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
Trusting that he will not ask in vain, the psalmist then
prays that God would "keep" his soul as a watchful
guardian or sentry does, and that, as the result of such
care, he may be saved from impending perils. Nor do
his desires limit themselves to deliverance. They rise
to more inward and select manifestations of God's heart
of tenderness, for the prayer "Be gracious" asks for
such, and so goes deeper into the blessedness of the
devout life than the preceding. And the crown of all
these requests is "Rejoice the soul of Thy servant," with
the joy which flows from experience of outward deliverance
and of inward whispers of God's grace, heard in
the silent depths of communion with Him. It matters
not that every petition has parallels in other psalms,
which this singer is quoting. His desires are none the
less his, because they have been shared by a company
of devout souls before him. His expression of them is
none the less his, because his very words have been
uttered by others. There is rest in thus associating
oneself with an innumerable multitude who have "cried
to God and been lightened." The petition in ver. 1
is like that in Psalm lv. 2. Ver. 2 sounds like a reminiscence
of Psalm xxv. 20; ver. 3 closely resembles
Psalm lvii. 1.</p>

<p>The pleas on which the petitions are grounded are
also beautifully wreathed together. First, the psalmist
asks to be heard because he is afflicted and poor (compare
Psalm xl. 17). Our need is a valid plea with a
faithful God. The sense of it drives us to Him; and
our recognition of poverty and want must underlie all
faithful appeal to Him. The second plea is capable
of two interpretations. The psalmist says that he is
<i>Chasid</i>; and that word is by some commentators taken
to mean <i>one who exercises</i>, and by others <i>one who is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
subject of, Chesed</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, loving-kindness. As has been
already remarked on Psalm iv. 3, the passive meaning&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
one to whom God's loving-kindness is shown&mdash;is
preferable. Here it is distinctly better than the other.
The psalmist is not presenting his own character as a
plea, but urging God's gracious relation to him, which,
once entered on, pledges God to unchanging continuance
in manifesting His loving-kindness. But,
though the psalmist does not plead his character, he
does, in the subsequent pleas, present his faith, his
daily and day-long prayers, and his lifting of his
desires, aspirations, and whole self above the trivialities
of earth to set them on God. These are valid pleas
with Him. It cannot be that trust fixed on Him should
be disappointed, nor that cries perpetually rising to His
ears should be unanswered, nor that a soul stretching
its tendrils heavenward should fail to find the strong
stay, round which it can cling and climb. God owns
the force of such appeals, and delights to be moved to
answer, by the spreading before Him of His servant's
faith and longings.</p>

<p>But all the psalmist's other pleas are merged at last
in that one contained in ver. 5, where he gazes on the
revealed Name of God, and thinks of Him as He had
been described of old, and as this suppliant delights
to set to his seal that he has found Him to be&mdash;good
and placable, and rich in loving-kindness. God is His
own motive, and Faith can find nothing mightier to
urge with God, nor any surer answer to its own doubts
to urge with itself, than the unfolding of all that lies
in the Name of the Lord. These pleas, like the
petitions which they support, are largely echoes of
older words. "Afflicted and poor" comes, as just
noticed, from Psalm xl. 17. The designation of "one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
whom God favours" is from Psalm iv. 3. "Unto Thee do
I lift up my soul" is taken verbatim from Psalm xxv. 1.
The explication of the contents of the Name of the
Lord, like the fuller one in ver. 15, is based upon Exod.
xxxiv. 6.</p>

<p>Vv. 6-13 may be taken together, as the prayer
proper, to which vv. 1-5 are introductory. In them
there is, first, a repetition of the cry for help, and of
the declaration of need (vv. 6, 7); then a joyful contemplation
of God's unapproachable majesty and works,
which insure the ultimate recognition of His Name by
all nations (vv. 8-10); then a profoundly and tenderly
spiritual prayer for guidance and consecration&mdash;wants
more pressing still than outward deliverance (ver. 11);
and, finally, as in so many psalms, anticipatory thanksgivings
for deliverance yet future, but conceived of as
present by vivid faith.</p>

<p>Echoes of earlier psalms sound through the whole;
but the general impression is not that of imitation, but
of genuine personal need and devotion. Ver. 7 is like
Psalm xvii. 6 and other passages; ver. 8 <i>a</i> is from
Exod. xv. 11; ver. 8 <i>b</i> is modelled on Deut. iii. 24;
ver. 9, on Psalm xxii. 27; ver. 11 <i>a</i>, on Psalm xxvii. 11;
ver. 11 <i>b</i>, on Psalm xxvi. 3; "Sheol beneath" is from
Deut. xxxii. 22. But, withal, there are unity and progress
in this cento of citations. The psalmist begins
with reiterating his cry that God would hear, and in
ver. 7 advances to the assurance that He will. Then
in vv. 8-10 he turns from all his other pleas to dwell
on his final one (ver. 5) of the Divine character. As,
in the former verse, he had rested his calm hope on
God's willingness to help, so now he strengthens himself,
in assurance of an answer, by the thought of God's
unmatched power, the unique majesty of His works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
and His sole Divinity. Ver. 8 might seem to assert
only Jehovah's supremacy above other gods of the
heathen; but ver. 10 shows that the psalmist speaks
the language of pure Monotheism. Most naturally the
prophetic assurance that all nations shall come and
worship Him is deduced from His sovereign power
and incomparableness. It cannot be that "the nations
whom Thou hast made" shall for ever remain ignorant
of the hand that made them. Sooner or later that
great character shall be seen by all men in its solitary
elevation; and universal praise shall correspond to His
sole Divinity.</p>

<p>The thought of God's sovereign power carries the
psalmist beyond remembrance of his immediate outward
needs, and stirs higher desires in him. Hence spring
the beautiful and spiritual petitions of ver. 11, which
seek for clearer insight into God's will concerning the
psalmist's conduct, breathe aspirations after a "walk"
in that God-appointed way and in "Thy troth," and
culminate in one of the sweetest and deepest prayers
of the Psalter: "Unite my heart to fear Thy Name."
There, at least, the psalmist speaks words borrowed from
no other, but springing fresh from his heart's depths.
Jer. xxxii. 39 is the nearest parallel, and the commandment
in Deut. vi. 5, to love God "with all thine heart,"
may have been in the psalmist's mind; but the prayer
is all his own. He has known the misery of a divided
heart, the affections and purposes of which are drawn
in manifold directions, and are arrayed in conflict
against each other. There is no peace nor blessedness,
neither is any nobility of life possible, without whole-hearted
devotion to one great object; and there is
no object capable of evoking such devotion or worthy
to receive it, except Him who is "God alone."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
Divided love is no love. It must be "all in all, or
not at all." With deep truth, the command to love God
with all the heart is based upon His Unity&mdash;"Hear,
O Israel: The Lord thy God is one Lord; and thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart"
(Deut. vi. 4). The very conception of religion requires
that it should be exclusive, and should dominate the
whole nature. It is only God who is great enough to
fill and engage all our capacities. Only the mass of
the central sun is weighty enough to make giant orbs
its satellites, and to wheel them in their courses. There
is no tranquillity nor any power in lives frittered away
on a thousand petty loves. The river that breaks into
a multitude of channels is sucked up in the sand without
reaching the ocean, and has no force in its current
to scour away obstructions. Concentration makes
strong men; consecration makes saints. "This one
thing I do" is the motto of all who have done anything
worthy. "Unite my heart to fear Thy Name"
is the prayer of all whose devotion is worthy of its
object, and is the source of joy and power to themselves.
The psalmist asks for a heart made one with itself
in the fear of God, and then vows that, with that united
heart, he will praise his delivering God. As in many
other psalms, he anticipates the answers to his prayers,
and in ver. 13 speaks of God's loving-kindness as
freshly manifested to him, and of deliverance from the
dismal depths of the unseen world, which threatened
to swallow him up. It seems more in accordance with
the usage in similar psalms to regard ver. 13 as thus
recounting, with prophetic certainty, the coming deliverance
as if it were accomplished, than to suppose that
in it the psalmist is falling back on former instances of
God's rescuing grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<p>In the closing part (vv. 14-17), the psalmist describes
more precisely his danger. He is surrounded
by a rabble rout of proud and violent men, whose
enmity to him is, as in so many of the psalms of
persecuted singers, a proof of their forgetfulness of
God. Right against this rapid outline of his perils, he
sets the grand unfolding of the character of God in
ver. 15. It is still fuller than that in ver. 5, and, like
it, rests on Exod. xxxiv. Such juxtaposition is all that
is needed to show how little he has to fear from the
hostile crew. On one hand are they, in their insolence
and masterfulness, eagerly hunting after his life; on
the other is God with His infinite pity and loving-kindness.
Happy are they who can discern high above
dangers and foes the calm presence of the only God,
and, with hearts undistracted and undismayed, can
oppose to all that assails them the impenetrable shield
of the Name of the Lord! It concerns our peaceful
fronting of the darker facts of life, that we cultivate
the habit of never looking at dangers or sorrows without
seeing the helping God beside and above them.</p>

<p>The psalm ends with prayer for present help. If
God is, as the psalmist has seen Him to be, "full of
compassion and gracious," it is no presumptuous petition
that the streams of these perfections should be
made to flow towards a needy suppliant. "Be gracious
to <i>me</i>" asks that the light, which pours through the
universe, may fall on one heart, which is surrounded
by earth-born darkness. As in the introductory verses,
so in the closing petitions, the psalmist grounds his
prayer principally on God's manifested character, and
secondarily on his own relation to God. Thus in ver. 16
he pleads that he is God's servant, and "the son of Thy
handmaid" (compare Psalm cxvi. 16). That expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
does not imply any special piety in the psalmist's
mother, but pleads his hereditary relation as servant
to God, or, in other words, his belonging by birth to
Israel, as a reason for his prayers being heard. His
last petition for "a sign" does not necessarily mean a
miracle, but a clear manifestation of God's favour, which
might be as unmistakably shown by an every-day
event as by a supernatural intervention. To the
devout heart, all common things are from God, and
bear witness for Him. Even blind eyes and hard
hearts may be led to see and feel that God is the
helper and comforter of humble souls who trust in
Him. A heart that is made at peace with itself by the
fear of God, and has but one dominant purpose and
desire, will long for God's mercies, not only because
they have a bearing on its own outward well-being, but
because they will demonstrate that it is no vain thing
to wait on the Lord, and may lead some, who cherished
enmity to God's servant and alienation from Himself,
to learn the sweetness of His Name and the security
of trust in Him.</p>

<p>One clear note sounds in this remarkable psalm.
Its single theme is the incorporation of ancestral
foes and distant nations with the people of God.
Aliens are to be enrolled as home-born citizens of
Jerusalem. In modern words, the vision of a universal
Church, a brotherhood of humanity, shines radiant
before the seer. Other psalmists and prophets have
like insight into the future expansion of the nation,
but this psalm stands alone in the emphasis which
it places upon the idea of birth into the rights of
citizenship. This singer has had granted to him a
glimpse of two great truths&mdash;the universality of the
Church, and the mode of entrance into it by reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
of a new life. To what age of Israel he belonged is
uncertain. The mention of Babylon as among the
enemies who have become fellow-citizens favours the
supposition of a post-exilic date, which is also supported
by resemblances to Isa. xl.-lxvi.</p>

<p>The structure is simple. The psalm is divided by
Selah into two strophes, to which a closing verse
is appended. The first strophe bursts abruptly into
rapturous praise of Zion, the beloved of God. The
second predicts the gathering of all nations into her
citizenship, and the closing verse apparently paints
the exuberant joy of the festal crowds, who shall then
throng her streets.</p>

<p>The abrupt beginning of the first strophe offends
some commentators, who have tried to smooth ver. 1
into propriety and tameness, by suggesting possible
preliminary clauses, which they suppose to have
dropped out. But there is no canon which forbids a
singer, with the rush of inspiration, either poetic or
other, on him, to plunge into the heart of his theme.
Ver. 1 may be construed, as in the A.V. and R.V. (text),
as a complete sentence, but is then somewhat feeble.
It is better to connect it with ver. 2, and to regard
"His foundation upon the holy mountains" as parallel
with "the gates of Zion," and as, like that phrase,
dependent on the verb "loves." Hupfeld, indeed,
proposes to transfer "Jehovah loves" from the beginning
of ver. 2, where it now stands, to the end
of ver. 1, supplying the verb mentally in the second
clause. He thus gets a complete parallelism:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His foundation upon the holy mountains Jehovah loves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gates of Zion before all the dwellings of Jacob.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But this is not necessary; for the verb may as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
be supplied to the first as to the second clause. The
harshness of saying "His foundation," without designating
the person to whom the pronoun refers, which
is extreme if ver. 1 is taken as a separate sentence,
is diminished when it is regarded as connected with
ver. 2, in which the mention of Jehovah leaves no
doubt as to whose the "foundation" is. The psalmist's
fervent love for Jerusalem is something more than
national pride. It is the apotheosis of that emotion,
clarified and hallowed into religion. Zion is founded
by God Himself. The mountains on which it stands
are made holy by the Divine dwelling. On their
heads shines a glory before which the light that lies
on the rock crowned by the Parthenon or on the seven
hills of Rome pales. Not only the Temple mountain
is meant, but the city is the psalmist's theme. The
hills, on which it stands, are emblems of the firmness
of its foundation in the Divine purpose, on which it
reposes. It is beloved of God, and that, as the form
of the word "loves" shows, with an abiding affection.
The "glorious things" which are spoken of Zion may
be either the immediately following Divine oracle, or,
more probably, prophetic utterances such as many of
those in Isaiah, which predict its future glory. The
Divine utterance which follows expresses the substance
of these. So far, the psalm is not unlike other
outpourings in praise of Zion, such as Psalm xlviii.
But, in the second strophe, to which the first is introductory,
the singer strikes a note all his own.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt as to who is the speaker
in ver. 4. The abrupt introduction of a Divine Oracle
accords with a not infrequent usage in the Psalter,
which adds much to the solemnity of the words. If
we regard the "glorious things" mentioned in ver. 3<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
as being the utterances of earlier prophets, the psalmist
has had his ears purged to hear God's voice, by meditation
on and sympathy with these. The faithful use
of what God has said prepares for hearing further
disclosures of His lips. The enumeration of nations in
ver. 4 carries a great lesson. First comes the ancient
enemy, Egypt, designated by the old name of contempt
(Rahab, <i>i.e.</i> pride), but from which the contempt has
faded; then follows Babylon, the more recent inflicter
of many miseries, once so detested, but towards whom
animosity has died down. These two, as the chief
oppressors, between whom, like a piece of metal between
hammer and anvil, Israel's territory lay, are named first,
with the astonishing declaration that God will proclaim
them as among those who know Him. That knowledge,
of course, is not merely intellectual, but the deeper
knowledge of personal acquaintance or friendship&mdash;a
knowledge of which love is an element, and which is
vital and transforming. Philistia is the old neighbour
and foe, which from the beginning had hung on the
skirts of Israel, and been ever ready to utilise her
disasters and add to them. Tyre is the type of godless
luxury and inflated material prosperity, and, though
often in friendly alliance with Israel, as being exposed
to the same foes which harassed her, she was as far
from knowing God as the other nations were. Cush,
or Ethiopia, seems mentioned as a type of distant
peoples, rather than because of its hostility to Israel.
God points to these nations&mdash;some of them near, some
remote, some powerful and some feeble, some hereditarily
hostile and some more or less amicable with
Israel&mdash;and gives forth the declaration concerning them,
"This one was born there."</p>

<p>God's voice ceases, and in ver. 5 the psalmist takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
up the wonderful promise which he has just heard.
He slightly shifts his point of view: for while the
nations that were to be gathered into Zion were the
foremost figures in the Divine utterance, the Zion into
which they are gathered is foremost in the psalmist's,
in ver. 5. Its glory, when thus enriched by a multitude
of new citizens, bulks in his eyes more largely than
their blessedness. Another shade of difference between
the two verses is that, in the former, the ingathering
of the peoples is set forth as collective or national
incorporation, and, in me latter,&mdash;as the expression
"man after (or <i>by</i>) man" suggests,&mdash;individual accession
is more clearly foretold. The establishment of
Zion, which the psalmist prophesies, is the result of her
reinforcement by these new citizens. The grand figure
of ver. 6 pictures God as taking a census of the whole
world; for it is "the peoples" whom He numbers.
As he writes down each name, He says concerning it,
"This one was born there." That list of citizens is
"the Book of the Living." So "the end of all history
is that Zion becomes the metropolis of all people"
(Delitzsch).</p>

<p>Three great truths had dawned on this psalmist,
though their full light was reserved for the Christian
era. He had been led to apprehend that the Jewish
Church would expand into a world-wide community.
If one thinks of the gulfs of hatred and incompatibility
which parted the peoples in his day, his clear utterance
of that great truth, the apprehension of which so far
transcended his time, and the realisation of which so
far transcends ours, will surely be seen to be due to
a Divine breath. The broadest New Testament expression
of Universalism does not surpass the psalmist's
confident certainty, "There is neither Greek nor Jew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
barbarian, Scythian," says no more than he said.
More remarkable still is his conception of the method
by which the nations should be gathered in to Zion.
They are to be "born there." Surely there shines
before the speaker some glimmering ray of the truth
that incorporation with the people of God is effected
by the communication of a new life, a transformation
of the natural, which will set men in new affinities, and
make them all brethren, because all participant of the
same wondrous birth. It would be anachronism to
read into the psalm the clear Christian truth "Ye
must be born again," but it would be as false a
weakening of its words to refuse to see in them the
germ of that truth. The third discovery which the
psalmist has made, or rather the third revelation which
he has received, is that of the individual accession of
the members of the outlying nations. The Divine voice,
in ver. 4, seems to speak of birth into citizenship as
national; but the psalmist, in ver. 6, represents Jehovah
as writing the names of individuals in the burgess-roll,
and of saying in regard to each, as He writes, "This
one was born there." In like manner, in ver. 5, the
form of expression is "Man after man," which brings
out the same thought, with the addition that there is an
unbroken series of new citizens. It is by accession of
single souls that the population of Zion is increased.
God's register resolves the community into its component
units. Men are born one by one, and one by
one they enter the true kingdom. In the ancient world
the community was more than the individual. But in
Christ the individual acquires new worth, while the
bands of social order are not thereby weakened, but
made more stringent and sacred. The city, whose
inhabitants have one by one been won by its King, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
have been knit to Him in the sacred depths of personal
being, is more closely "compact together" than the
mechanical aggregations which call themselves civil
societies. The unity of Christ's kingdom does not
destroy national characteristics any more than it interferes
with individual idiosyncrasies. The more each
constituent member is himself, the more will he be
joined to others, and contribute his special mite to the
general wealth and well-being.</p>

<p>Ver. 7 is, on any interpretation, extremely obscure,
because so abrupt and condensed. But probably the
translation adopted above, though by no means free
from difficulty or doubt, brings out the meaning which
is most in accordance with the preceding. It may be
supposed to flash vividly before the reader's imagination
the picture of a triumphal procession of rejoicing
citizens, singers as well as dancers, who chant, as
they advance, a joyous chorus in praise of the city, in
which they have found all fountains of joy and satisfaction
welling up for their refreshment and delight.</p>

</p>


<p>A psalm which begins with "God of my salvation"
and ends with "darkness" is an anomaly.
All but unbroken gloom broods over it, and is densest
at its close. The psalmist is so "weighed upon by
sore distress," that he has neither definite petition
for deliverance nor hope. His cry to God is only
a long-drawn complaint, which brings no respite from
his pains nor brightening of his spirit. But yet to
address God as the God of his salvation, to discern
His hand in the infliction of sorrows, is the operation
of true though feeble faith. "Though He slay me,
yet will I trust in Him," is the very spirit of this
psalm. It stands alone in the Psalter, which would
be incomplete as a mirror of phases of devout experience,
unless it had one psalm expressing trust which
has ceased to ask or hope for the removal of lifelong
griefs, but still clasps God's hand even in the
"darkness." Such experience is comparatively rare,
and is meant to be risen above. Therefore this psalm
stands alone. But it is not unexampled, and all
moods of the devout life would not find lyrical expression
in the book unless this deep note was once
sounded.</p>

<p>It is useless to inquire what was the psalmist's
affliction. His language seems to point to physical
disease, of long continuance and ever threatening a
fatal termination; but in all probability sickness is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
symbol here, as so often. What racked his sensitive
spirit matters little. The cry which his pains evoked
is what we are concerned with. There is little trace
of strophical arrangement, and commentators differ
much in their disposition of the parts of the psalm.
But we venture to suggest a principle of division which
has not been observed, in the threefold recurrence of
"I cry" or "I call," accompanied in each case by
direct address to Jehovah. The resulting division
into three parts gives, first, the psalmist's description
of his hopeless condition as, in effect, already dead
(vv. 1-8); second, an expostulation with God on the
ground that, if the psalmist is actually numbered with
the dead, he can no more be the object of Divine help,
nor bring God praise (vv. 9-12); and, third, a repetition
of the thoughts of the first part, with slight variation
and addition.</p>

<p>The central portion of the first division is occupied
with an expansion of the thought that the psalmist is
already as good as dead (vv. 3 <i>b</i>-6). The condition
of the dead is drawn with a powerful hand, and the
picture is full of solemn grandeur and hopelessness.
It is preceded in vv. 1, 2, by an invocation which has
many parallels in the psalms, but which here is peculiarly
striking. This saddest of them all has for its
first words the Name which ought to banish sadness.
He who can call on Jehovah as the God of his salvation
possesses a charm which has power to still
agitation, and to flush despair with some light of hope
as from an unrisen sun. But this poet feels no warmth
from the beams, and the mists surge up, if not to hide
the light, yet to obscure it. All the more admirable,
then, the persistence of his cry; and all the more
precious the lesson that Faith is not to let present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
experience limit its conceptions. God is none the less
the God of salvation and none the less to be believed
to be so, though no consciousness of His saving power
blesses the heart at the moment.</p>

<p>Ver. 1 <i>b</i> is obscure. Psalm xxii. 2 and other places
suggest that the juxtaposition of day and night is
meant to express the continuity of the psalmist's prayer;
but, as the text now stands, the first part of the clause
can only mean "In the time (day) when I cry," and
the second has to be supplemented so as to read "[My
cry comes] before Thee." This gives a poor meaning,
and there is probability in the slight emendation on
the word for <i>day</i>, which is required in order to make
it an adverb of time equivalent to "In the day," as
in the passage already quoted. Another emendation,
adopted by Graetz, Bickell, and Cheyne, changes "God
of" into "my God," and "my salvation" into "I cry"
(the same word as in ver. 13), and attaches "by day"
to the first clause. The result is,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jehovah, my God, I cry to Thee by day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I call in the night before Thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The changes are very slight and easy, and the effect
of them is satisfactory. The meaning of the verse
is obvious, whether the emendation is accepted or not.
The gain from the proposed change is dearly purchased
by the loss of that solitary expression of hope in the
name of "God of my salvation," the one star which
gleams for a moment through a rift in the blackness.</p>

<p>With "For" in ver. 3 the psalmist begins the dreary
description of his affliction, the desperate and all but
deodly character of which he spreads before God as
a reason for hearing his prayer. Despair sometimes
strikes men dumb, and sometimes makes them eloquent.
The sorrow which has a voice is less crushing than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
that which is tongueless. This overcharged heart finds
relief in self-pitying depicting of its burdens, and in
the exercise of a gloomy imagination, which draws out
in detail the picture of the feebleness, the recumbent
stillness, the seclusion and darkness of the dead.
They have "no strength." Their vital force has ebbed
away, and they are but as weak shadows, having an
impotent existence, which does not deserve to be called
life. The remarkable expression of ver. 5, "free among
the dead," is to be interpreted in the light of Job iii. 19,
which counts it as one blessing of the grave, that
"there the servant is free from his master." But the
psalmist thinks that that "freedom" is loathsome, not
desirable, for it means removal from the stir of a life,
the heaviest duties and cares of which are better than
the torpid immunity from these, which makes the state
of the dead a dreary monotony. They lie stretched
out and motionless. No ripple of cheerful activity stirs
that stagnant sea. One unvarying attitude is theirs.
It is not the stillness of rest which prepares for work,
but of incapacity of action or of change. They are
forgotten by Him who remembers all that are. They
are parted from the guiding and blessing influence of
the Hand that upholds all being. In some strange
fashion they are and yet are not. Their death has
a simulacrum of life. Their shadowy life is death.
Being and non-being may both be predicated of them.
The psalmist speaks in riddles; and the contradictions
in his speech reflect his dim knowledge of that place
of darkness. He looks into its gloomy depths, and he
sees little but gloom. It needed the resurrection of
Jesus to flood these depths with light, and to show that
the life beyond may be fuller of bright activity than
life here&mdash;a state in which vital strength is increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
beyond all earthly experience, and wherein God's all-quickening
hand grasps more closely, and communicates
richer gifts than are attainable in that death which
sense calls life.</p>

<p>Ver. 7 traces the psalmist's sorrows to God. It
breathes not complaint but submission, or, at least,
recognition of His hand; and they who, in the very
paroxysm of their pains, can say, "It is the Lord," are
not far from saying, "Let Him do what seemeth Him
good," nor from the peace that comes from a compliant
will. The recognition implies, too, consciousness of sin
which has deserved the "wrath" of God, and in such
consciousness lies the germ of blessing. Sensitive
nerves may quiver, as they feel the dreadful weight
with which that wrath presses down on them, as if to
crush them; but if the man lies still, and lets the
pressure do its work, it will not force out his life, but
only his evil, as foul water is squeezed from cloth.
Ver. 7 <i>b</i> is rendered by Delitzsch "All Thy billows
Thou pressest down," which gives a vivid picture; but
"billows" is scarcely the word to use for the downward
rushing waters of a cataract, and the ordinary rendering,
adopted above, requires only natural supplements.</p>

<p>Ver. 8 approaches nearer to a specification of the
psalmist's affliction. If taken literally, it points to
some loathsome disease, which had long clung to
and made even his friends shrink from companionship,
and thus had condemned him to isolation. All
these details suggest leprosy, which, if referred to
here, is most probably to be taken, as sickness is in
several psalms, as symbolic of affliction. The desertion
by friends is a common feature in the psalmists' complaints.
The seclusion as in a prison-house is, no
doubt, appropriate to the leper's condition, but may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
also simply refer to the loneliness and compulsory
inaction arising from heavy trials. At all events, the
psalmist is flung back friendless on himself, and hemmed
in, so that he cannot expatiate in the joyous bustle of
life. Blessed are they who, when thus situated, can
betake themselves to God, and find that He does
not turn away! The consciousness of His loving
presence has not yet lighted the psalmist's soul; but
the clear acknowledgment that it is God who has put
the sweetness of earthly companionship beyond his
reach is, at least, the beginning of the happier experience,
that God never makes a solitude round a soul
without desiring to fill it with Himself.</p>

<p>If the recurring cry to Jehovah in ver. 9 is taken,
as we have suggested it should be, as marking a new
turn in the thoughts, the second part of the psalm will
include vv. 9-12. Vv. 10-12 are apparently the daily
prayer referred to in ver. 9. They appeal to God to
preserve the psalmist from the state of death, which
he has just depicted himself as having in effect
already entered, by the consideration which is urged
in other psalms as a reason for Divine intervention
(vi. 5, xxx. 9, etc.)&mdash;namely, that His power had no field
for its manifestation in the grave, and that He could
draw no revenue of praise from the pale lips that lay
silent there. The conception of the state of the dead
is even more dreary than that in vv. 4, 5. They are
"shades," which word conveys the idea of relaxed
feebleness. Their dwelling is Abaddon&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, "destruction,"&mdash;"darkness,"
"the land of forgetfulness" whose
inhabitants remember not, nor are remembered, either
by God or man. In that cheerless region, God had no
opportunity to show His wonders of delivering mercy,
for monotonous immobility was stamped upon it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
out of that realm of silence no glad songs of praise
could sound. Such thoughts are in startling contrast
with the hopes that sparkle in some psalms (such as
xvi. 10, etc.), and they show that clear, permanent
assurance of future blessedness was not granted to the
ancient Church. Nor could there be sober certainty of
it until after Christ's resurrection. But it is also to be
noticed that this psalm neither affirms nor denies a future
resurrection. It does affirm continuous personal existence
after death, of however thin and shadowy a sort.
It is not concerned with what may lie far ahead, but
is speaking of the present state of the dead, as it was
conceived of, at the then stage of revelation, by a devout
soul, in its hours of despondency.</p>

<p>The last part (vv. 13-18) is marked, like the two
preceding, by the repetition of the name of Jehovah,
and of the allusion to the psalmist's continual prayer.
It is remarkable, and perhaps significant, that the time
of prayer should here be "the morning," whereas in
ver. 1 it was, according to Delitzsch, <i>the night</i>, or,
according to the other rendering, <i>day and night</i>. The
psalmist had asked in ver. 2 that his prayer might
enter into God's presence; he now vows that it will
come to meet Him. Possibly some lightening of his
burden may be hinted at by the reference to the time
of his petition. Morning is the hour of hope, of new
vigour, of a fresh beginning, which may not be only a
prolongation of dreary yesterdays. But if there is any
such alleviation, it is only for a moment, and then the
cloud settles down still more heavily. But one thing
the psalmist has won by his cry. He now longs to
know the reason for his affliction. He is confident that
God is righteous when He afflicts, and, heavy as his
sorrow is, he has passed beyond mere complaint concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
it, to the wish to understand it. The consciousness
that it is chastisement, occasioned by his own evil,
and meant to purge that evil away, is present, in a
rudimentary form at least, in that cry, "<i>Why</i> castest
Thou off my soul?" If sorrow has brought a man to
offer that prayer, it has done its work, and will cease
before long, or, if it lasts, will be easier to bear, when
its meaning and purpose are clear. But the psalmist
rises to such a height but for a moment, though his
momentary attaining it gives promise that he will, by
degrees, be able to remain there permanently. It is
significant that the only direct naming of Jehovah, in
addition to the three which accompany the references
to his prayers, is associated with this petition for
enlightenment. The singer presses close to God in
his faith that His hardest blows are not struck at
random, and that His administration has for its basis,
not caprice, but reason, moved by love and righteousness.</p>

<p>Such a cry is never offered in vain, even though
it should be followed, as it is here, by plaintive reiterations
of the sufferer's pains. These are now little more
than a summary of the first part. The same idea of
being in effect dead even while alive is repeated in
ver. 15, in which the psalmist wails that from youth
he had been but a dying man, so close to him had death
seemed, or so death-like had been his life. He has
borne God's terrors till he is distracted. The word
rendered "I am distracted" is only used here, and
consequently is obscure. Hupfeld and others deny
that it is a word at all (he calls it an "Unwort"), and
would read another which means <i>to become torpid</i>. The
existing text is defended by Delitzsch and others, who
take the word to mean to be weakened in mind or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
bewildered. The meaning of the whole seems to be
as rendered above. But it might also be translated,
as by Cheyne, "I bear Thy terrors, my senses must
fail." In ver. 16 the word for wrath is in the plural,
to express the manifold outbursts of that deadly indignation.
The word means literally heat; and we may
represent the psalmist's thought as being that the wrath
shoots forth many fierce tongues of licking flame, or, like
a lava stream, pours out in many branches. The word
rendered "Cut me off" is anomalous, and is variously
translated <i>annihilate</i>, <i>extinguish</i>, or as above. The wrath
which was a fiery name in ver. 16 is an overwhelming
flood in ver. 17. The complaint of ver. 8 recurs in
ver. 18, in still more tragic form. All human sympathy
and help are far away, and the psalmist's only familiar
friend is&mdash;darkness. There is an infinitude of despair
in that sad irony. But there is a gleam of hope, though
faint and far, like faint daylight seen from the innermost
recesses of a dark tunnel, in his recognition that
his dismal solitude is the work of God's hand; for, if
God has made a heart or a life empty of human love,
it is that He may Himself fill it with His own sweet
and all-compensating presence.</p>

<p>The foundation of this psalm is the promise in
2 Sam. vii. which guaranteed the perpetuity of
the Davidic kingdom. Many of the characteristic
phrases of the prophecy recur here&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the promises
that the children of wickedness shall not afflict, and
that the transgressions of David's descendants should
be followed by chastisement only, not by rejection.
The contents of Nathan's oracle are first given in brief
in vv. 3, 4&mdash;"like a text," as Hupfeld says&mdash;and again
in detail and with poetic embellishments in vv. 19-37.
But these glorious promises are set in sharpest contrast
with a doleful present, which seems to contradict
them. They not only embitter it, but they bewilder
faith, and the psalmist's lament is made almost a reproach
of God, whose faithfulness seems imperilled
by the disasters which had fallen on the monarchy and
on Israel. The complaint and petitions of the latter
part are the true burden of the psalm, to which the
celebration of Divine attributes in vv. 1-18, and the
expansion of the fundamental promise in vv. 19-37,
are meant to lead up. The attributes specified are
those of Faithfulness (vv. 1, 2, 5, 8, 14) and of
Power, which render the fulfilment of God's promises
certain. By such contemplations the psalmist would
fortify himself against the whispers of doubt, which
were beginning to make themselves heard in his mind,
and would find in the character of God both assurance
that His promise shall not fail, and a powerful plea
for his prayer that it may not fail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole tone of the psalm suggests that it was
written when the kingdom was toppling to ruin, or
perhaps even after its fall. Delitzsch improbably
supposes that the young king, whom loss and
shame make an old man (ver. 45), is Rehoboam,
and that the disasters which gave occasion to the
psalm were those inflicted by the Egyptian king
Shishak. Others see in that youthful prince Jehoiachin,
who reigned for three months, and was then deposed
by Nebuchadnezzar, and whom Jeremiah has bewailed
(xxii. 24-29). But all such conjectures are
precarious.</p>

<p>The structure of the psalm can scarcely be called
strophical. There are three well-marked turns in the
flow of thought,&mdash;first, the hymn to the Divine attributes
(vv. 1-18); second, the expansion of the promise,
which is the basis of the monarchy (vv. 19-37); and,
finally, the lament and prayer, in view of present
afflictions, that God would be true to His attributes
and promises (vv. 38-51). For the most part the
verses are grouped in pairs, which are occasionally
lengthened into triplets.</p>

<p>The psalmist begins with announcing the theme of
his song&mdash;the Loving-kindness and Faithfulness of God.
Surrounded by disasters, which seem in violent contradiction
to God's promise to David, he falls back on
thoughts of the Mercy which gave it and the Faithfulness
which will surely accomplish it. The resolve
to celebrate these in such circumstances argues a faith
victorious over doubts, and putting forth energetic
efforts to maintain itself. This bird can sing in midwinter.
True, the song has other notes than joyous
ones, but they, too, extol God's Loving-kindness and
Faithfulness, even while they seem to question them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
Self-command, which insists on a man's averting his
thoughts from a gloomy outward present to gaze on
God's loving purpose and unalterable veracity, is no
small part of practical religion. The psalmist will <i>sing</i>,
because he <i>said</i> that these two attributes were ever
in operation, and lasting as the heavens. "Loving-kindness
snail be built up for ever," its various
manifestations being conceived as each being a stone
in the stately building which is in continual course
of progress through all ages, and can never be completed,
since fresh stones will continually be laid, as
long as God lives and pours forth His blessings. Much
less can it ever fall into ruin, as impatient sense would
persuade the psalmist that it is doing in his day. The
parallel declaration as to God's Faithfulness takes the
heavens as the type of duration and immobility, and
conceives that attribute to be eternal and fixed, as
they are. These convictions could not burn in the
psalmist's heart without forcing him to speak. Lover,
poet, and devout man, in their several ways, feel the
same necessity of utterance. Not every Christian can
"sing," but all can and should speak. They will, if
their faith is strong.</p>

<p>The Divine promise, on which the Davidic throne
rests, is summed up in the abruptly introduced pair
of verses (3, 4). That promise is the second theme
of the psalm; and just as, in some great musical composition,
the overture sounds for the first time phrases
which are to be recurrent and elaborated in the sequel,
so, in the four first verses of the psalm, its ruling
thoughts are briefly put. Vv. 1, 2, stand first, but
are second in time to vv. 3, 4. God's oracle preceded
the singer's praise. The language of these two
verses echoes the original passage in 2 Sam. vii., as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
"<i>David My servant</i>, <i>establish</i>, <i>for ever</i>, <i>build</i>," the last
three of which expressions were used in ver. 2, with
a view to their recurrence in ver. 4. The music keeps
before the mind the perpetual duration of David's
throne.</p>

<p>In vv. 6-18 the psalmist sets forth the Power and
Faithfulness of God, which insure the fulfilment of His
promises. He is the incomparably great and terrible
God, who subdues the mightiest forces of nature and
tames the proudest nations (vv. 9, 10), who is Maker and
Lord of the world (vv. 11, 12), who rules with power,
but also with righteousness, faithfulness, and grace
(vv. 13, 14), and who, therefore, makes His people
blessed and safe (vv. 15-18). Since God is such a
God, His promise cannot remain unfulfilled. Power
and willingness to execute it to the last tittle are
witnessed by heaven and earth, by history and experience.
Dark as the present may be, it would,
therefore, be folly to doubt for a moment.</p>

<p>The psalmist begins his contemplations of the glory
of the Divine nature with figuring the very heavens as
vocal with His praise. Not only the object but the
givers of that praise are noteworthy. The heavens
are personified, as in Psalm xix.; and from their silent
depths comes music. There is One higher, mightier,
older, more unperturbed, pure, and enduring than
they, whom they extol by their lustre which they
owe to Him. They praise God's "wonder" (which
here means, not so much His marvellous acts, as the
wonderfulness of His Being, His incomparable greatness
and power), and His Faithfulness, the two
guarantees of the fulfilment of His promises. Nor are
the visible heavens His only praisers. The holy ones,
sons of the mighty&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the angels&mdash;bow before Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
who is high above their holiness and might, and own
Him for God alone.</p>

<p>With ver. 9 the hymn descends to earth, and
magnifies God's Power and Faithfulness as manifested
there. The sea is, as always, the emblem of rebellious
tumult. Its insolence is calmed by Him. And the
proudest of the nations, such as Rahab ("Pride,"
a current name for Egypt), had cause to own His
power, when He brought the waves of the sea over
her hosts, thus in one act exemplifying His sovereign
sway over both nature and nations. He is Maker, and
therefore Lord, of heaven and earth. In all quarters
of the world His creative hand is manifest, and His
praise sounds. Tabor and Hermon may stand, as the
parallelism requires, for west and east, though some
suppose that they are simply named as conspicuous
summits. They "shout for joy at Thy Name," an expression
like that used in ver. 16, in reference to Israel.
The poet thinks of the softly swelling Tabor with its
verdure, and of the lofty Hermon with its snows, as
sharing in that gladness, and praising Him to whom
they owe their beauty and majesty. Creation vibrates
with the same emotions which thrill the poet. The
sum of all the preceding is gathered up in ver. 13,
which magnifies the might of God's arm.</p>

<p>But more blessed still for the psalmist, in the midst
of national gloom, is the other thought of the moral
character of God's rule. His throne is broad-based
upon the sure foundation of righteousness and justice.
The pair of attributes always closely connected&mdash;namely,
Loving-kindness and Troth or Faithfulness&mdash;are
here, as frequently, personified. They "go to
meet Thy face"&mdash;that is, in order to present themselves
before Him. "The two genii of the history of redemption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
(Psalm xliii. 3) stand before His countenance, like
attendant maidens, waiting the slightest indication of
His will" (Delitzsch).</p>

<p>Since God is such a God, His Israel is blessed,
whatever its present plight. So the psalmist closes
the first part of his song, with rapturous celebration
of the favoured nation's prerogatives. "The festal
shout" or "the trumpet-blast" is probably the music
at the festivals (Numb. xxiii. 21 and xxxi. 6), and "those
who know" it means "those who are familiar with the
worship of this great God." The elements of their
blessedness are then unfolded. "They walk in the
light of Thy face." Their outward life is passed in
continual happy consciousness of the Divine presence,
which becomes to them a source of gladness and
guidance. "In Thy Name do they exult all the
day." God's self-manifestation, and the knowledge of
Him which arises therefrom, become the occasion of
a calm, perpetual joy, which is secure from change,
because its roots go deeper than the region where
change works. "In Thy righteousness shall they be
exalted." Through God's strict adherence to His
covenant, not by any power of their own, shall they
be lifted above foes and fears. "The glory of their
strength art Thou." In themselves they are weak, but
Thou, not any arm of flesh, art their strength, and by
possession of Thee they are not only clothed with
might, but resplendent with beauty. Human power
is often unlovely; God-given strength is, like armour
inlaid with gold, ornament as well as defence. "In
Thy favour our horn shall be exalted." The psalmist
identifies himself at last with the people, whose blessedness
he has so glowingly celebrated. He could keep
up the appearance of distinction no longer. "They"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
gives place to "we" unconsciously, as his heart swells
with the joy which he paints. Depressed as he and
his people are for the moment, he is sure that there
is lifting up. The emblem of the lifted horn is common,
as expressive of victory. The psalmist is confident
of Israel's triumph, because he is certain that the
nation, as represented by and, as it were, concentrated
in its king, belongs to God, who will not lose what
is His. The rendering of ver. 18 in the A.V. cannot
be sustained. "Our shield" in the first clause is
parallel with "our king" in the second, and the
meaning of both clauses is that the king of Israel is
God's, and therefore secure. That ownership rests
on the promise to David, and on it in turn is rested
the psalmist's confidence that Israel and its king are
possessed of a charmed life, and shall be exalted, however
now abject and despondent.</p>

<p>The second part (vv. 19-37) draws out in detail, and
at some points with heightened colouring, the fundamental
prophecy by Nathan. It falls into two parts, of
which the former (vv. 19-27) refers more especially to
the promises given to David, and the second (vv. 28-37)
to those relating to his descendants. In ver. 19
"vision" is quoted from 2 Sam. vii. 17; "then" points
back to the period of giving the promise; "Thy
favoured one," is possibly Nathan, but more probably
David. The Masoretic reading, however, which is
followed by many ancient versions, has the plural
"favoured ones," which Delitzsch takes to mean Samuel
and Nathan. "Help" means the help which, through
the king, comes to his people, and especially, as appears
from the use of the word "hero," aid in battle. But
since the selection of David for the throne is the subject
in hand, the emendation which reads for "help" <i>crown</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
recommends itself as probable. David's prowess, his
humble origin, and his devotion to God's service are
brought into view in vv. 19, 20, as explaining and
magnifying the Divine choice. His dignity is all from
God. Consequently, as the next pair of verses goes
on to say, God's protecting hand will ever be with
him, since He cannot set a man in any position and
fail to supply the gifts needed for it. Whom He
chooses He will protect. Sheltered behind that strong
hand, the king will be safe from all assaults. The
word rendered "steal upon" in ver. 22 is doubtful,
and by some is taken to mean <i>to exact</i>, as a creditor
does, but that gives a flat and incongruous turn to
the promise. For ver. 22 <i>b</i> compare 2 Sam. vii. 10.
Victory over all enemies is next promised in vv. 23-25,
and is traced to the perpetual presence with the king
of God's Faithfulness and Loving-kindness, the two
attributes of which so much has been sung in the
former part. The manifestation of God's character (<i>i.e.</i>,
His Name) will secure the exaltation of David's horn&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the victorious exercise of his God-given strength.
Therefore a wide extension of his kingdom is promised
in ver. 25, from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates
and its canals, on which God will lay the king's hand&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
will put them in his possession.</p>

<p>The next pair of verses (26, 27) deals with the
inward side of the relations of God and the king. On
David's part there will be child-like love, with all the
lowliness of trust and obedience which lies in the
recognition of God's fatherhood, and on God's part
there will be the acknowledgment of the relation, and
the adoption of the king as His "first-born," and therefore,
in a special sense, beloved and exalted. Israel is
called by the same name in other places, in reference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
to its special prerogative amongst the nations. The
national dignity is concentrated in the king, who stands
to other monarchs as Israel to other nations, and is to
them "Most High," the august Divine title, which here
may possibly mean that David is to the rulers of the
earth an image of God. The reciprocal relation of Father
and Son is not here conceived in its full inwardness
and depth as Christianity knows it, for it has reference
to office rather than to the person sustaining the office,
but it is approximating thereto. There is an echo of
the fundamental passage in ver. 26. (Compare 2 Sam.
vii. 14.)</p>

<p>From ver. 28 onwards the psalmist turns to expand
the promises to David's line. His words are mainly a
poetical paraphrase of 2 Sam. vii. 14. Transgression
shall indeed be visited with chastisement, which the
fatherly relation requires, as the original passage indicates
by the juxtaposition of the promise "I will be
his Father," and the declaration "I will chasten him."
But it will be chastisement only, and not rejection.
The unchangeableness of God's loving purpose is very
strongly and beautifully put in ver. 33, in which the
twin attributes of Loving-kindness and Faithfulness are
again blended as the ground of sinful men's hope. The
word rendered above "break off" occasions a difficulty,
both in regard to its form and its appropriateness in
this connection. The clause is a quotation from 2 Sam.
vii. 15, and the emendation which substitutes for <i>break
off</i> the more natural word used there&mdash;namely, <i>withdraw</i>&mdash;is
to be preferred. In ver. 33 b the paradoxical
expression of <i>being false to My faithfulness</i> suggests the
contradiction inherent in the very thought that He can
break His plighted word. The same idea is again put
in striking form in ver. 34: "I will not profane My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
covenant," even though degenerate sons of David
"profane" God's statute. His word, once spoken, is
inviolable. He is bound by His oath. He has given
His holiness as the pledge of His word, and, till that
holiness wanes, those utterances which He has sealed
with it cannot be recalled. The certainty that sin
does not alter God's promise is not traced here to
His placableness, but to His immutable nature, and to
the obligations under which He is laid by His own
word and acts. That unchangeableness is a rock-foundation,
on which sinful men may build their certitude.
It is much to know that they cannot sin away
God's mercy nor exhaust His gentle long-suffering. It
is even more to know that His holiness guarantees that
they cannot sin away His promises, nor by any breach
of His commandments provoke Him to break His
covenant.</p>

<p>The allusions to the ancient promise are completed
in vv. 36, 37, with the thought of the perpetual continuance
of the Davidic line and kingdom, expressed by the
familiar comparison of its duration to that of the sun
and moon. Ver. 37 <i>b</i> is best understood as above.
Some take the faithful witness to be the moon; others
the rainbow, and render, as in the A.V. and R.V., "and
as the faithful witness." But the designation of the
moon as a witness is unexampled and almost unintelligible.
It is better to take the clause as independent,
and to suppose that Jehovah is His own witness, and
that the psalmist here speaks in his own person, the
quotation of the promises being ended. Cheyne encloses
the clause in a parenthesis and compares Rev. iii. 14.</p>

<p>The third part begins with ver. 38, and consists of
two portions, in the first of which the psalmist complains
with extraordinary boldness of remonstrance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
and describes the contrast between these lofty promises
and the sad reality (vv. 38-45), and, in the second
prays for the removal of the contradiction of God's
promise by Israel's affliction, and bases this petition
on the double ground of the shortness of life, and the
dishonour done to His own Name thereby.</p>

<p>The expostulation very nearly crosses the boundary
of reverent remonstrance, when it charges God with
having Himself "abhorred" or, according to another
rendering, "made void" His covenant, and cast the
king's crown to the ground. The devastation of the
kingdom is described, in vv. 40, 41, in language borrowed
from Psalm lxxx. 12. The pronouns grammatically
refer to the king, but the ideas of the land and the
monarch are blended. The next pair of verses (42, 43)
ventures still further in remonstrance, by charging God
with taking the side of Israel's enemies and actively
intervening to procure its defeat. The last verse-pair
of this part (44, 45) speaks more exclusively of the
king, or perhaps of the monarchy. The language,
especially in ver. 45 <i>a</i>, seems most naturally understood
of an individual. Delitzsch takes such to be its
application, and supposes it to describe the king as
having been prematurely aged by calamity; while Hupfeld,
with Hengstenberg and others, prefer to regard
the expression as lamenting that the early days of the
monarchy's vigour had so soon been succeeded by
decrepitude like that of age. That family, which had
been promised perpetual duration and dominion, has
lost its lustre, and is like a dying lamp. That throne
has fallen to the ground, which God had promised
should stand for ever. Senile weakness has stricken
the monarchy, and disaster, which makes it an object
of contempt, wraps it like a garment, instead of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
royal robe. A long, sad wail of the music fixes the
picture on the mind of the hearer.</p>

<p>Then follows prayer, which shows how consistent with
true reverence and humble dependence is the outspoken
vigour of the preceding remonstrance. The boldest
thoughts about the apparent contradiction of God's words
and deeds are not too bold, if spoken straight to Him,
and not muttered against Him, and if they lead the
speaker to prayer for the removal of the anomaly. In
ver. 46 there is a quotation from Psalm lxxix. 5. The
question "How long" is the more imploring because life
is so short. There is but a little while during which it
is possible for God to manifest Himself as full of Loving-kindness
and Faithfulness. The psalmist lets his feelings
of longing to see for himself the manifestation
of these attributes peep forth for a moment, in that
pathetic sudden emergence of "I" instead of "we" or
"men," in ver. 47 <i>a</i>. His language is somewhat obscure,
but the sense is clear. Literally, the words read
"Remember&mdash;I, what a transitoriness." The meaning
is plain enough, when it is observed that, as Perowne
rightly says, "I" is placed first for the sake of emphasis.
It is a tender thought that God may be moved to show
forth His Loving-kindness by remembrance of the brief
period within which a man's opportunity of beholding it
is restricted, and by the consideration that so soon he
will have to look on a grimmer sight, and "see death."
The music again comes in with a melancholy cadence,
emphasising the sadness which enwraps man's short
life, if no gleams of God's loving-kindness fall on its
fleeting days.</p>

<p>The last three verses (vv. 49-51) urge yet another
plea&mdash;that of the dishonour accruing to God from the
continuance of Israel's disasters. A second "Remember"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
presents that plea, which is preceded by the wistful
question "Where are Thy former loving-kindnesses?"
The psalmist looks back on the glories of early days,
and the retrospect is bitter and bewildering. That
these were sworn to David in God's faithfulness
staggers him, but he makes the fact a plea with God.
Then in vv. 50, 51, he urges the insults and reproaches
which enemies hurled against him and against "Thy
servants," and therefore against God.</p>

<p>Ver. 50 <i>b</i> is obscure. To "bear in the bosom"
usually implies tender care, but here can only mean
sympathetic participation. The psalmist again lets his
own personality appear for a moment, while he identifies
himself as a member of the nation with "Thy servants"
and "Thine anointed." The last words of the clause
are so obscure that there must apparently have been
textual corruption. If the existing text is retained, the
object of the verb <i>I bear</i> must be supplied from <i>a</i>, and
this clause will run, "I bear in my bosom the reproach
of all the many peoples." But the collocation of <i>all</i>
and <i>many</i> is harsh, and the position of <i>many</i> is
anomalous. An ingenious conjecture, adopted by
Cheyne from Böttcher and Bickell, and accepted by
Baethgen, reads for "all, many peoples," <i>the shame of
the peoples</i>, which gives a good meaning, and may be
received as at all events probable, and expressing the
intent of the psalmist. Insolent conquerors and their
armies triumph over the fallen Israel, and "reproach
the footsteps" of the dethroned king or royal line&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
they pursue him with their taunts, wherever he goes.
These reproaches cut deep into the singer's heart;
but they glance off from the earthly objects and strike
the majesty of Heaven. God's people cannot be
flouted without His honour being touched. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
the prayer goes up, that the Lord would remember
these jeers which mocked Him as well as His afflicted
people, and would arise to action on behalf of His
own Name. His Loving-kindness and Faithfulness,
which the psalmist has magnified, and on which he
rests his hopes, are darkened in the eyes of men and
even of His own nation by the calamities, which give
point to the rude gibes of the enemy. Therefore the
closing petitions beseech God to think on these reproaches,
and to bring into act once more His Loving-kindness,
and to vindicate His Faithfulness, which He
had sealed to David by His oath.</p>

<p>Ver. 52 is no part of the original psalm, but is the
closing doxology of Book III.</p>
